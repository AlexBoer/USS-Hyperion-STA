The called in backup from the Hyperion and Jarek Vossin and Jonathan Belaris arrived with Captain Rhen Gorath. The 5 of them descended into the borg facility several hundred meters under the sand.There, they found several levels containing 10 Ithik clones, each one in a vat of the same nanite-jelly as on Abyss Station. These Ithik has cybernetics plugged into them. They had been assimilated.Deeper into the Borg facility, they found an engine room with a deactivated artificial singularity reactor. In the center of this room was a pedestal with a head in a jar. The head was integrated into the ship via cybernetic implants. They welcomed the crew in and referred to many of the crew members by their names. They were incredibly surprised to learn that the Borg were still out there, but then quickly just asked if they had discovered the progenitors yet.The Borg claimed to be created by the Tilikaal, showing an image that looked remarkably like Thaccin. When asked about where the Ithik came from, the Face of Borg claimed that the Ithik were provided to it, and were of course meant to be assimilated, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.When asked what it's goals were and what it would do if it escape, the Face of Borg claimed that they would explore the stars, looking for the Tilikaal. Their ultimate goal: assimilate with them.Sorketh did some research into the history of the Borg, using his remaining Borg implants. He identified the Ithik as species number 9 under Borg designations. And the Face of Borg was identified as species number 3. Notably, these designations were not given by the Borg themselves.The crew wanted to know if the Face of Borg had a sense of empathy and a respect for independent life, unlike the Borg of the present day. So the devised an empathy test that put on a display of atrocities and accomplishments that species all around the galaxy have done. This was put into a virtual reality experience and uploaded onto the Borg's computers. The Face of Borg passed the test.

However, the Face of Borg HAD assimilated the Ithik, and so this empathy was not universal. The crew decided to do some more investigation.SILAR and Rhen Gorath went to Akkara, who was still on the Hyperion hoping to find a new home among the stars. Akkara didn't know anything about the Borg, but implored the officers to speak to Thaccin for him. Thaccin had been avoiding the Ithik, who regarded him as a god. SILAR showed Akkara a recording of the assimilated Ithik in the Borg ship, and Akkara was horrified. He then begged the officers to go down to the planet and free his people from their fate, and even wanted to go down to the planet himself.Jarek Vossin went down to the Borg ship again to investigate the technology. He told the Face of Borg that he was attempting to begin repairs, which was not true. Jarek Vossin uncovered an encrypted log, which even the Face of Borg did not have access to. He bypassed some of the security, and revealed a recording where a Tilikaal woman dragged an Ithik out of a thank, put them on a surgery table, and manually installed Borg implants.Jonathan Belaris went to speak to Thaccin, whose memory had been broken by spending too long in a pattern butter. Belaris convinced Thaccin to undergo some neurological repair therapy. As Belarus asked Thaccin to recall certain parts of him memory, he was able to identify "dead zones" where lost memories were stored. Through this therapy, Thaccin was able to recall another Tilikaal named Ash-Tamalia, who apparently designed the Ithik people themselves to be like lab rats. He also remember being afraid of something, and wanting to put himself in the pattern buffer to get away from it.Rhen Gorath gave Starfleet command a call, and Admiral April Hebert gave the following direction: Eliminate the Borg threat, strongly implying that all Borg should be killed. Hebert also ordered the colonists to be evacuated permanently. But the crew of the Hyperion had another plan: liberate the assimilated Ithik and take the Face of Borg in securely for study.An away from with SILAR, Gorath, Vossin, and Belarus went back into the Borg ship. Jarek Vossin was able to convince the Face of Borg that they would need to be disconnected from the ship in order to continue repairs. They successfully disconnected the Face of Borg, and then SILAR and Belarus went to another level to attempt to disconnect a borg drone from the small collective.They drained a tank of it's gel, and a single Ithik fell to the ground before standing up. SILAR and Belarus hit the drone with a mega dose of sedatives, and it went to sleep. They disconnected a communications module from the back of the Ithik's neck, and suddenly the Ithik's own nanite's started to reject the Borg implants. The implants melted away as if my acid, leaving gaping wounds in its flesh.

<br>Jarek Vossin grew up on <a data-href="Terpen-4" href="crew/terpen-4.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Terpen-4</a>, an isolated mining colony located on the fringe of Federation space. Terpin-4, an M Class planet, is surrounded by asteroids thought to be the remains of a moon that shattered due to tidal forces.The composition of these asteroids makes them randomly resonate with Terpen IV’s magnetic field which generates a lot of interference. This causes issues with transporters (especially surface-to-orbit) leaving them unreliable, thus leading to most shipments on and off the planet being performed by complex shuttle routes, further isolating the colony from resources.Due to these circumstances, Jarek grew up having to repair and jury-rig things on the fly using the materials at hand. He showed an aptitude for mechanics and engineering and was involved with the mining operations, working closely with his father who was a mechanic. The asteroid situation has also generated a culture where piloting skills are highly regarded.The more daring youth of the colony have even made competitions of shuttle racing through the asteroids. Jarek spent time on these flying runs and has become a capable pilot. Showing promise in many disciplines, Jarek was encouraged to attend Starfleet Academy by his uncle who was enlisted, and after graduation he has served on several Federation starships as a junior officer before gaining his first senior assignment on the USS Hyperion as Operation Manager.Table2 resultsSort2Filter1PropertiesNewList of MissionsMission14 Pasqual's Progress]]></description><link>crew/jarek-vossin.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Crew/Jarek Vossin.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 08:42:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="." length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="."&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jonathan Belaris]]></title><description><![CDATA[Info

While the Hyperion-A continued attempting to negotiate, the Vinshari ships closed in on both the nebula and the Starfleet vessel.Once in position, the Vinshari launched twelve single-person fighters, which entered the nebula and moved to attack the freighters. The Hyperion-A fired a volley of quantum torpedoes that destroyed six of the fighters and damaged one of the larger Vinshari Maelstrom ships. The Hyperion-A then shifted fire to a second Vinshari Maelstrom in the area.The remaining six Vinshari fighters were able to harpoon one of the freighters and drag it toward a Vinshari Maelstrom, latching it to the larger hull. In response, the Hyperion-A flew directly into the nebula and deployed its own shuttle swarm under Commander SILAR. Within the nebula, the Hyperion-A and its shuttles used phaser fire both to damage the Vinshari ship and to sever the harpoon connections holding the freighter in place, successfully freeing the civilian ship.After the freighter was freed, the Hyperion-A continued its attack on the Vinshari Maelstrom. A further round of phaser fire completely disabled the Vinshari vessel. The second Maelstrom chose to retreat from the area, leaving its disabled counterpart and some remaining assets behind.The captain of the disabled Vinshari ship then challenged the Hyperion crew to board and fight to the death aboard the crippled vessel. Captain Rhen Gorath declined this challenge, stating that the Hyperion-A would leave the Vinshari ship to conduct its own repairs and offering help if they needed it.Because the Vinshari ship’s sensors were too damaged to locate survivors in the surrounding wreckage, the Hyperion-A used its own sensors to find Vinshari survivors in the debris field and then beamed them over to the disabled Maelstrom. Before leaving the area, the Hyperion-A took detailed scans of the Vinshari Maelstrom, sufficient to create an accurate holodeck simulation of the ship for future training, and then departed, leaving the Vinshari to repair their vessel.After leaving the site of the Vinshari attack, the Hyperion continued on to the convoy's destination planet. It was habitable, but undergoing severe dessertification. The colonist set up and got to work on initial terraforming efforts.SILAR took a shuttle to scan for underground water reservoirs, but instead found an neutronium deposit, indicating Tilikaal facilities in the area. With Enat Tera and Sorketh, they descended into the neutronium facility. There were some consoles that Sorketh attempted to hack, but was attacked by an advanced security system.Further downwards, they found Ithik people, much like the ones on Chaktir, who had been assimilated by what looked like Borg tech.]]></description><link>mission-logs/season-2/hyperion-log-13.2-defending-the-convoy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 2/Hyperion Log 13.2 - Defending the Convoy.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:05:40 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thaval th'Kerre]]></title><description><![CDATA[Info

Previously, the entire Vinshari race was almost completely exterminated, aside from those who would have been away from their home system.As the Hyperion was running away. Time seemed to freeze. On the bridge, Q appeared and spoke to SILAR, Sorketh and Rhen Gorath. Q gloated over them and questioned them, asking if they were happy with all their decisions.Q then took the crew through a series of trials, presenting them with each situation and each decision that they made along the way and asking them how they would do things differently. Each of these situations had other outcomes that they could could have taken, and there were other trade offs and other sacrifices that needed to be made. But given the benefit of hindsight, the three officers were able to make different decisions and show Q that actually they were were able to make good ones.Happy with the results of his test Q decided to reverse the consequences of their decisions.

When the team materialized, the Romulans were already taking cover.Enat Tara took a disruptor hit and dropped. Sorketh stunned the Romulan bridge commander. Eric hit a couple of Romulans with a grenade before being hit in the back and getting a life-threatening disruptor burn.SILAR jumped to a console, hacked the ship’s systems, and remotely overpressured three enemy workstations, knocking out their operators. With the immediate threat contained, SILAR stabilized Eric while Sorketh brought up internal forcefields to lock down the bridge. Partial control of local systems was secured but they had not yet gained full control of the ship.Meanwhile, Rhen Gorath was recovering from injuries on the Hyperion, and T'Lor recommended staying in bed to heal. Rhen Gorath ordered T'Lor to give him some pain killers so that he can reclaim command of the Hyperion. Captain Gorath then ordered Rega to take a science team to the Tilikaal space station and figure out how to open a wormhole connecting back to Narendra Station.

At the same time, Rhen Gorath was asked by Starfleet legal to lead the prosecution, in an attempt to set the defense off balance.SILAR Argued that the Admiral had a good service record, and was within her rights to pursue her mission t explore the Shackleton expanse.Rhen Gorath began by arguing that Stoker had gone outside standard Starfleet protocol, ignoring normal chains of command and refusing to utilize the resources she was responsible for organizing.Verlath talked to Averly Stoker about his mother. Averly was vaguely aware of the trial and disapproved of his mother's reckless behaviour. He said he thought it was better if his mother left Starfleet and got away from whatever was driving this obsession.SILAR looked up Admiral Stoker's communications with her son, Averly. The communications included Stoker's insisting that she would find proof Averly "isn't crazy." She wanted to find out what caused her son to hear voices in the Shackleton Expanse and steal a shuttle, leading to his own discharge from Starfleet. Banna Stoker also admitted to Averly that she heard voices too.When the artifact was brought into the room, it connected with Sorketh's nanoprobes. Sorketh began to seize and Verlath struggled to administer medical care to Sorketh's cyborg body. At Sorketh's suggestion, Verlath dragged Sorketh into an electro-plasma conduit, where Tetra-radiation burned away the nano-probe modified flesh faster than the vulcan flesh.Later Sorketh was able to compare his own nanoprobe's signal's responding to the artifact with the background noise of the Shackleton Expanse's "Washboard". He used sensor data from both Narendra station and Epsilon-19 to identify a source of remote signals that the artifact may be commanded from. The signals led to a system called Omega Draconis.Admiral Nolan and General Kargan delivered the verdict. Banna Stoker would be put on an indefinite leave and be returned to earth for further medical examination.After the trial, SILAR received a distress call on his personal tracking device from captain Kala Cerjaso.]]></description><link>mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-9-order-in-court.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 1/Hyperion Log 9 - Order in Court.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:33:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyperion Log 1.1 - Bacchus' Irresistible Call]]></title><description><![CDATA[The USS Hyperion was sent to investigate the disappearance of a Starfleet science shuttle at the Bacchus system.

At the same time, a team on the Hyperion would attempt to outfit the starship to escape the Bacchus system by riding the Subspace wave out. The away team disabled the security system at the entrance to the monolith and navigated to the control room at the center. There a computer system informed them that the Facility was built to contained something or someone called The Displaced. Verlath was able to recognize genetic codes in the displays with telltale signs of modifications.In the end, the team disabled the subspace distortion wave, which triggered an emergency response from the facility. A breadbox sized artifact that the computer described as a "key" was revealed, which the away team took with them. The planet produced a massive tractor beam and pulled the planet Bacchus-2 out of orbit. It began using the rocky material of the planet to create new Monoliths.On the Hyperion, Buchanon and SILAR worked to integrate SILAR more deeply into the ship's control systems. The ship's sensors were connected directly to the nacelles to respond more quickly to changes in subspace. And SILAR's decision making processes were set as the control point for ship. SILAR was able to respond more quickly to changes in the gravitational profile of the system.

Buchanan made a deal with Nax to take a crate of stem bolts off the station.Verlath was brought into the sick bay to help stabilize Kassandra Pruitt, whose neurological functions were suddenly declining after a research project with the Bacchus Artifact. Soon after, the artifact was stolen, and the crew of the Hyperion recruited to help track it down. Collectively, they narrowed the options down to an Orion ship, the SS Castle Rock, that had left the station shortly after the theft.The Hyperion was sent in pursuit of the Castle Rock before it could get to the neutral zone, but was not fast enough. There, the Castle Rock was found disabled: the back section crushed in by some gravitational field coming from the artifact. The Orion captain Paljara refused to hand over the artifact and warned the Hyperion to flee. When they didn't, a Romulan Bird of Prey decloaked and announced their intention to "protect" the Orion vessel, who had been given passage rights.

She seemed distressed and was unable to explain to the officers why a crew member was interfaced with the artifact.Meanwhile, Verlath, Enat, and Eric moved to the other side of the ship to retrieve the artifact. The plan was to meet back in the middle and beam out without anyone knowing the wiser. They followed a Orion pirate to the cargo hold, where they saw 1 Orion interfaced with the Bacchus Artifact using a neural net.Unfortunately, Enat lost his temper with Verlath and his raised voice alerted some Orion pirates in the destroyed cargo hold. While Enat laid down supressing fire and held back the Romulans at the other end of the ship, Ensign Eric shot an explosive barrel in the cargo hold. This took out 3 Orions, one of whcih was the one interfaced with the artidfact. The artifact was thrown across the room by the explosion.During this fight, Captain Paljara hailed the Hyperion and begged Rhen Gorath to let them go with the artifiact. Paljara explained that her sister was beingheld by the Romulans and that the artifact was her ransom. Without it, her sister may be killed.Verlath ran across to grab it, but was beaten there by a pirate, who was then stunned. Verlath brought the artifact towards the Orion previously interfaced with it and set up pattern enhancers to beam out. The away team regrouped at the pattern engancer and beamed out.Meanwhile, Rhen Gorath had been engaging in debate and discussion with te Romulan sub-commander Thal'vaek. Commander Gorath was attempting to distract Thal'vaek until the away team could make it back to the Hyperion, and Thal'vaek was similarly trying to buy his officers time while they recovered the artifact. Thal'vaek challenged Gorath on their place in Starfleet, suggesting that all officers are just tools for government powers.When the away team returned with the artifact, Thal'vaek found out what had happened and ordered his ship to fire on the Hyperion. The Hyperion was able to warp out of the neutral zone quickly while taking damage to their shields.Back on Narendra Station, Admiral Banna Stoker congratulated the crew of the Hyperion and asked for the Artifact to be returned to the lab for her to inspect later. She dismissed concerns about the Orion casualties and declined to organize a rescue mission for Paljara's sister, potentially somewhere in Romulan space.]]></description><link>mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-3.2-orion-heist-part-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 1/Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:32:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyperion Log 4 - Peas to Meet You]]></title><description><![CDATA[The USS Hyperion was sent to investigate the USS Constantine, a Galaxy Class starship itself tasked with transporting an agricultural exchange from the Colony on Re-Alpha to a struggling colony on Yacci.

She warned she was attacked and may have been followed, so the Hyperion was not to respond to hails and travel at maximum warp. Suspicious of these orders, the crew of the Hyperion investigated. A medical examination showed the Admiral seemed to have no influence from the Artifact's subspace signals. Her shuttles logs showed that Stoker had visited several systems in the Shackleton Expanse before arriving at the Hyperion.The Hyperion found the planet Pasqual-1, inhabited by a late-medieval society and covered in hundreds of black neutronium monoliths. Stoker wanted an away team to investigate, but Rhen Gorath and the rest of the crew refused. Stoker was furious, and threatened to have Rhen Gorath reprimanded for disobeying orders.Before the Hyperion could leave the system, a unidentified starship dropped out of warp and demanded Stoker hand over the artifact. They claimed that Stoker was in possession of their property. The unidentified ship attacked, and both ships have now sustained damage to their shields.]]></description><link>mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 1/Hyperion Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:32:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyperion Log 5.2 - The Pasqual Solution]]></title><description><![CDATA[At Pasqual-1, the Hyperion continued to engage with the Vinshari battlecruiser, which hooked onto the Hyperion with a physical harpoon. But the Hyperion created a sensor shadow to fake the image of another starship in the system. This caused the Vinshari ship to retreat behind the planet and swing around and attack from the other side.The Hyperion disabled the Vinshari starship, effectively opening it up to negotiations again. Admiral Stoker was confined to quarters after attempting to destroy the defenceless Vinshari vessel. The captain, introducing herself as "Captain Casai", restated that the Admiral had trespassed into Vinshari space and was in possession of Vinshari property, alluding to the Bacchus artifact Stoker carried with her. The Vinshari's claim to the Bacchus artifact was ancestral. Captain Kala Cerjaso distrusted the Vinshari, but equally distrusted the Admiral. She offered to follow the Vinshari back to their homeworld to conduct more formal negotiations with the Vinshari leadership.The Vinshari did not wish to reveal the location of their homeworld to the Federation, so instead, Captain Cerjaso agreed to join the Vinshari vessel an return with them into the Shackleton Expanse.

There, a Romulan Warbird commanded by sub-commander Thal'vaek claimed the crew members as prisoners of war.After a short negotiation, Thalvaek allowed an away team on board the Nightingale to help the injured and life support systems. The Nightingale's executive officer, Cmdr. Allison Lewis, was now in command. Captain Blake had died in the attack. Lewis explained that most of the ships functions had been completely disabled by the Romulan Protocol, an emergency system to prevent enemies from gaining access to Federation intel or commandeering a Federation ship.Verlath started by heading to the ship's sick-bay, and found dead and wounded taking up space even in the corridors outside. Verlath helped the nurses do triage and treated some of the worst patients. Among the dead, Verlath found Captain Blake, who had suffered a head injury apparently moments after activating the Romulan protocol.Lt. Buchanon made his way to the Nightingale's engineering room to evaluate the damage and attempt to restore power to the rest of the ship. There, he found most of the engineering team dead, and an electro-plasma conduit aflame. He extinguished the electro-plasma fire by shutting off avalve to the conduit, and then gain access to the engineering console. Although the ship's computers had completely shut off access from the the Romulan protocol, Buchanon could hot wire the engineering consoles to gain basic local functions.On board the Hyperion, Thal'vaek routinely commented on the novelty of SILAR's nature, and was morbidly curious about it. So SILAR challenged Thal'vaek to a wrestling match. The terms: If SILAR wins, then Thal'vaek would leave the Nightingale alone and return to Romulan space. If Thal'vaek won, then SILAR would submit himself for study under the Romulans.As negotiations with Thal'vaek continued, a Federation shuttle departed from the Nightingale on course to join the Warbird. The Hyperion extended it's shields around the shuttle and caught it in its tractor beam. T'Lek was on board the shuttle and quickly arrested for attempting to abscond intel to the Romulans.However, as T'Lek was arrested, Thal'vaek quickly pulled a phaser off of Rhen Gorath's belt and killed T'Lek with it. Thal'vaek told Captain Gorath that he has taken care of a Romulan spy in their midst, and asked to be returned to his ship. Under threat of being fired upon by the Warbird, and potentially starting a war, Thalvaek was returned to his ship, and the Hyperion departed.]]></description><link>mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-6-border-dispute.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 1/Hyperion Log 6 - Border Dispute.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:32:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyperion Log 7 - Holo Spies]]></title><description><![CDATA[As Star Fleet prepared for Admiral Stoker’s trial, Chief Engineer Nak was picking apart her shuttle, looking for hidden evidence. He found a holodeck program, created on the shuttle itself during her solo excursion into the Shackleton Expanse. Nak agreed to give it to the bridge crew of the Hyperion, on condition that he be allowed to come see what's in the program with them.The program was a pulpy 1950's themed spy mission, where the party was tasked with recovering atomic bomb blueprints from a german weapons dealer named Mr Halgrave.Halgrave was hosting a birthday party, where multiple other people were trying to acquire the plans. Most of the other guests were invited by Halgrave for his supposed birthday party. But Allied intelligence suspected the party was cover for an auction.At the party, Halgrave was no where to be seen. But the crew met with several would-be buyers at the auction. Slowly, they pieced together that Mr. Halgrave had no intention of selling the atomic weapons. Instead, Halgrave intended to murder everyone at the party, including his own delinquent son.Verlath remembered just in the nick of time to pause the program and request the computer remove all the weapons from Mr. Halgrave and his goons. With their weapons missing, Halgrave quickly surrendered to the crew and showed the atomic weapons blueprints to them.But the blueprints were not blueprints at all. Instead, there was a large conspiracy board full of logs, maps, and other data pertaining to Stoker’s solo adventure into the Shackleton Expanse, including a star map of suspected “Facility” locations and first-contact conversations with people calling themselves Akaru and Vinshari. In these conversation, Stoker attempted to threaten these new civilizations with the power of the Federation unless they revealed any ancient alien artifacts or facilities on their planets.]]></description><link>mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-7-holo-spies.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 1/Hyperion Log 7 - Holo Spies.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:32:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyperion Log 8.1 - Epsilon 19]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Hyperion was assigned to deliver scientific equipment to the small Epsilon 19 starbase at the Osarin system.

Meanwhile, the Hyperion left to go study the nearby star.While aboard the station, acting Captain Gorath, SILAR, Verlath, Buchanon, Eric, and the new tactical officer Sorketh got dinner with the station's commanding officer, Commander Johansson. At dinner, they met an Orion woman named Helestia Baenor, who had brought a number of luxuries to the station as gifts to thank the officers for allowing her crew to rest at the station. Helestia turned out to be the sister of another Orion, Paljara. And the Hudson's crew thought Helestia to be dead.After getting a tour of the station, the Hudson's delegation were aboard a turbolift when the station suffered a massive explosion at several points. They took some injuries, but suddenly triolic radiation from the nearby star started irradiating them.The crew escaped from the burning turbolift and found the science labs Buchanon was able to get a temporary transporter working using technology in the labs.

Together, they re-established limited comms and worked to reconnect with the rest of Epsilon-19. In engineering, Sorketh and Buchanon had identified the phase-shifted energy parasites feeding on the station’s fusion reactor.Sorketh proposed a plan. They temporarily shut down the reactor, encouraging the parasites to detach. They measured the parasites phase frequency and sent out a probe that would attract them. Once the probe had drawn away the parasites, they reactivated the reactor and modulated the station's shields online to keep the parasites out.With sensors returning, SILAR and Gorath detected an Orion freighter near the station. They hailed Helestia and warned her to power down before the parasites latched onto her ship. Sorketh pulled the station logs and found the freighter’s manifest, uploaded by mistake when it docked, which included stolen Federation weapons and sensor tech. The logs also showed Helestia entering engineering just before the shielding failed.Meanwhile, the Hyperion was caught in a parasite swarm near the sun. The creatures infiltrated its fusion systems, and the ship began falling into the star’s gravity well. Thaval surfed the surface of the sun, using solar flares to shake the parasites loose.Once the Hyperion returned, Sorketh and SILAR executed a micro-warp jump to flank the Orion freighter and locked it in a tractor beam. Helestia claimed she was saving the equipment from the exploding station and offered to return it in exchange for her freedom. Instead, she was arrested.Back on Epsilon-19, Verlath helped Buchanon stabilized station systems and trained the crew in emergency burn treatment. While repairing the damage, they discovered that several engineers had been killed by Nausicaans when Helestia sabotaged the shield grid.]]></description><link>mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-8.2-fading-sun.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 1/Hyperion Log 8.2 - Fading Sun.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:32:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyperion Log 0 - All Aboard]]></title><link>mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-0-all-aboard.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 1/Hyperion Log 0 - All Aboard.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:31:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyperion Log 13.1 - Convoy SE-119]]></title><description><![CDATA[Table0 resultsSortFilterPropertiesNewThe USS Hyperion returned from the Seku system to Narendra Station and discovered that, due to time dilation, approximately a year had passed since they had last been there. In the meantime, Admiral Stoker had been sent back to Earth on leave and replaced by Admiral April Hebert. The crew spent about a week or two on the station, taking leave and reorienting themselves to the new situation.The Hyperion arrived with additional responsibilities: they offloaded castaways from the Seku system and people who had been rescued from the planet Chaktir via Abyss Station. They also returned in control of a Romulan warbird, which had to be secured and dealt with at Narendra Station. General Kargan was please with this "trophy" but Herbert was more cautious, saying that it should potentially be returned to the Romulans, who the Federation was currently assisting with evacuation efforts before the Hobus system goes supernova. They would hold onto the Warbird for the time being.Captain Rhen Gorath and the senior staff checked in with the new leadership, including Admiral Hebert and General Kargan. They discussed the overall situation in the Shackleton Expanse, focusing on the Tilikaal: Who they were, what had happened to them, and what technology might still be present in the region? The leadership also raised concerns about the Romulans searching for similar things and about the Vinshari, who had become increasingly aggressive since the Hyperion had previously freed a Ha'kiv, potentially the species' sole energy source.As a result of these developments and the crew’s record, Captain Rhen Gorath was given command of a larger Luna-class heavy cruiser. The new ship was christened the USS Hyperion-A. Their first mission in the Hyperion-A was to escort a convoy of about twelve Antares-class civilian colonist freighters toward a new planet in the Shackleton Expanse. After about a week of travel, the convoy was intercepted by Vinshari pirates, who demanded the freighters’ warp cores as energy sources. Rhen Gorath responded that they were on a peaceful mission and asked the Vinshari to leave them alone, but the Vinshari proceeded to attack.The freighters took cover in a Nebula before the Vinshari cruisers launched a small fleet of fighters. The Hyperion used a salvo of Quantum torpedoes to take out half the fighters, but the remaining fighters swarmed the freighters anyways.]]></description><link>mission-logs/season-2/hyperion-log-13.1-convoy-se-119.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 2/Hyperion Log 13.1 - Convoy SE-119.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:57:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EMH M4]]></title><description><![CDATA[Info

Two harpooned the Ha'kiv, attempting to capture it, while the other two attacked the Hyperion. The crew lured the attackers into a nearby gas giant and ignited its atmosphere, destroying both ships.After the battle, a Vinshari shuttle hailed them. It belonged to the Ar-Ka-Se, a Vinshari splinter faction aboard the Liberator under Captain J’Lara. She invited the Hyperion’s crew aboard and introduced them to Thacinn, a Tilikaal science officer and former Vinshari captive who had been experimented on.J’Lara explained that the Vinshari exploited adult Ha'kiv to power their homeworlds, a practice she believed was unethical and unsustainable. With Ha'kiv becoming increasingly rare, she hoped that freeing this one would force the Vinshari to seek alternative energy sources.

The crew observed a massive defensive drone network surrounding the planet, as well as a debris field filled with derelict ships stripped of power. Testing a probe confirmed the danger: two drones intercepted it, tore it apart, and drained its energy completely.To bypass the network, the crew hacked into the drone control systems, disguising the Hyperion as one of the drones to avoid detection. They then escalated the hack, reprogramming the drones to identify Vinshari ships as hostile targets. Chaos erupted as the drones turned inward, attacking Vinshari vessels and collapsing their defensive perimeter.Amid the confusion, the Hyperion deployed its Waverider to infiltrate a Vinshari barge carrying the captured Ha’kiv into a gas giant’s atmosphere. The team latched onto the underside of the barge and climbed through a maintenance chute into a sludge-processing chamber. Attempting stealth, SILAR tried to incapacitate a Vinshari with a Vulcan nerve pinch, but the alien’s physiology blocked the technique.

Inside, SILAR and Sorketh attempted to hack the ship’s security systems and reverse gravity but failed, forcing them instead to plunge the ship into darkness to gain an advantage. During the ensuing firefight, Captain J’Lara of the Ar-Ka-Se was shot and critically wounded; Verlath pulled her to safety and stabilized her injuries with emergency first aid.Rhen Gorath was able to call for a brief ceasefire, while Verlath dragged J’Lara back into the waverider for surgery. At that moment, the barge’s crew jettisoned the entire waste-processing section, sending Verlath, J’Lara, and the Waverider plummeting into the dense atmosphere below. Back on the barge, the away team used a flashbang grenade to stun nearby Vinshari, buying critical time to deploy pattern enhancers around the Ha’kiv.As Verlath struggled to pilot the Waverider against intense turbulence, believing he was moments from burning up, the Hyperion successfully beamed the Ha’kiv out into the planet’s atmosphere. Now free, the massive creature immediately began feeding on the gas giant’s rich atmosphere, glowing brightly as its energy output spiked. The Hyperion performed an emergency transport to extract the away team, Captain J’Lara, and more than 100 Vinshari survivors.

Chaktir from Omega Draconis had been flung here and was sling-shotting around the water planet (Seku-1). The Romulan warbird, previously dragged through the wormhole without impulse engine control was kept from crashing by tractor beams from the USS Hyperion and the Klingon Mupw’l. The Tilikaal Abyss Station held stable in orbit around Seku-1. Navigation checks failed to place their exact position in the Expanse.Sorketh confronted Subcommander Neral aboard the warbird and forced a mind meld using Borg hive techniques to extract command access. With the codes in hand, the crew took control of the warbird and began mass transports, moving roughly 1,500 Romulans into secured cargo bays with forcefields.A repeating distress signal consistent with Vinshari language was detected from the ocean world. Hails went unanswered, so the team chose to take the Mupw'l to use it's landing gear. The planet’s electromagnetic field knocked out impulse and maneuvering thrusters. While falling, a tidal tsunami caused by Chaktir's gravity slammed the ship, and the Mupw’l sank. Shields held. At the bottom of the ocean, a massive sea serpent descended on the ship. Eric restored weapons, fired photon torpedoes and disruptors, and killed the creature.Three submersibles arrived and a volcanoid woman named Noralith invited the team aboard. Unable to relaunch the Mupw’l, they transferred to the subs. Noralith initially mistook T’Lor for one of her people, the Akaru, and agreed to a mind meld that confirmed they were not from the same world.

To get into the city they had to kind of drive these submersibles through some underwater caves and them.The settlement was an ancient city, with large structure standing on stone columns to raise them above sea water. The people inside were all castaways. Some were Vinshari, others Klingon, many were Akaru.Noralith brought the Hyperion crew to the center of the settlement, where a large crystal generated the dome shield. Noralith explained that this crystal protected the settlement and gave the castaways a place to live. Her early attempts to scan and control the crystal resulted in strange fluctuations in the energy output, so she stopped, fearing that she might accidentally disable the crystal.On the Hyperion, SILAR was in command and had a daisy chain of drones enter the atmosphere of the planet. a stable transportation network was formed, and almost the entire crew was beamed off of the planet. But Rhen Gorath was left behind and the daisy chain collapsed.Rega was working on using abyss Station to create a micro wormhole to evacuate anyone left on the planet. The station used the mass of the planet Chaktir to create a pin-sized wormhole, just enough to thread a transportation beam through. This succeeded and many of the castaways were able to be removed form the planet. But as more castaways left, more wanted to go. Soon, it was a domino effect. Noralith lamented to Rhen Gorath that she had no where else to go, before joining the other rescued castaways.]]></description><link>mission-logs/season-2/hyperion-log-12.2-atlantis.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 2/Hyperion Log 12.2 - Atlantis.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 09:30:35 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Eric]]></title><description><![CDATA[Info

Peace between the Federation and the Empire has never been stronger. But it leaves Klingons restless with no one to fight.
Romulans are very afraid of the Federation and think they could be capable of anything
Cardassians are recovering, with Bajorans leading the way
Ferengi are undergoing a massive cultural shift: lying and scamming is starting to be seen as unprofitable. Others long to hold on to "the old ways"
Borg are quiet, but everyone is still on edge about them
The Dominion is closely guarded against, but individuals are allowed in after checking in as DS9
The Federation is at the height of its power and opponents have been allied with or defeated. Inspired by the return of Voyager (common knowledge, but the details of how are top secret), The Federation is looking forward to a new age of exploration further than they've ever gone before. From a reddit post <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/hsl9nh/a_setting_overview_for_2380/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/hsl9nh/a_setting_overview_for_2380/" target="_self">here</a>.
The adventure starts in the year 2385, 6 years after the USS Voyager returned to Earth, and 3 years after the conclusion of the Dominion War. The Alpha and Beta Quadrants are in an uneasy but stable peace.The Romulans are more wary and less arrogant in regard to the Federation. They have somehow become aware of actions Section 31 took to end the Dominion War, and contrary to the horror Federation leadership had when they learned of it, the Romulans seem to have taken it as a sign that they have gravely underestimated the Federation.From their perspective, the Federation encountered a civilization that attempted to subvert them and subjugate them in the Dominion, and instead of taking the expected actions by conceding everything one piece at a time until it was all lost, the Federation prompted direct confrontation by mining the wormhole and actively attacking their opponent’s logistical support.Once the war had begun, the Federation was able to somehow not only convince the Klingons to fight at their side, but to do so at the direction of Starfleet, which the Romulan government found to be a totally incredulous idea. A Starfleet captain had orchestrated the assassination of a Romulan Senator in order to manipulate them into fighting at the Federation’s side as well! Finally, the Federation showed a willingness to engage in total war when existentially threatened.Limited trade, and the continuation of the Neutral Zone as well as the Treaty of Algeron, will maintain the status quo while the Romulans put in effort to modernize and update their fleet and empire.The Klingons have become much closer to the Federation since the victory over the Cardassians and the Dominion. Many within the Houses have suggested that the consistency of honor in battle by Starfleet is a sign of a worthy ally, and that the empire should seek to continue the friendly relationship it now has with Starfleet and the Federation.This is at odds with the renewed thirst for battle that Klingon society is experiencing, however it is obvious now that the Federation would make terrible enemies if direct conflict happened, and it is unlikely that the Federation would stand by should the Klingon Empire seek to expand once again, even if it wasn’t near the Federation.Klingon society also depends heavily at this point on dilithium imports from the Federation, and their society has become far too economically tied to the Federation for open conflict to be anything except painful.Some Klingons suggest that in primarily exploring, the average Starfleet vessel encounters more battle than the average Klingon vessel does. Because of this, there is a growing sentiment that a Klingon who joins Starfleet has a better chance of finding glory than a Klingon who serves the empire. Some have even suggested that the empire should join the Federation and find glory in defending it against the many foes it has, some of which are quite formidable such as the Borg.This sentiment is not yet widespread, and though it is talked about by many Klingons, it is always in hushed voices. There have been many more Klingons who have joined Starfleet however, and while some were unable to make it in an environment where they needed to respect and follow the orders of non-Klingon superiors, others have found their lives to be much better and more fulfilling.There is also the risk of the thirst for battle being turned inward. Without a good path to conquer other societies, and with the conflict in opinion about the Federation, the stability of the Klingon Empire is threatened, and it is possible that a civil war may break out over cooperation with the Federation. This would be just as much due to their thirst for battle having no viable outlet as it would be to the disagreement itself.Utterly ruined by the war, Cardassian society totally collapsed due to the conflict. During the post-war occupation by the Federation, Klingons, and Romulans, Cardassian society was transformed. The common Cardassian was opened to the idea that while their loyalty had always been to the state, the state’s loyalty hadn’t always been to them.The catastrophic loss of life left the people open to new ideas, and during the four years of occupation and rebuilding (which ended officially in 2379), Bajoran society was perhaps ironically a huge influence on Cardassia.Cardassians now have a nascent society which values the art and culture of their people. They are all aware of just how close their society and culture came to extermination at the hands of either the Dominion or the Alliance forces, and there is an existential need among Cardassians to show that their culture is one worth preserving. That it is better for everyone that they didn’t die to the last man.The Detapa Council has been remade, but in a move that would have been unthinkable only a decade ago, most of its members are now elected by the people. In addition to the elected members, the council has two members that are elected by members of the military, one member who is elected by members of the remade Obsidian order, and one more member who is elected by Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory. This, combined with the five members elected by the Cardassian public, make up the nine people who make up the council.A large number of Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory live on Bajor, which is to some ironic. However, it is obvious to even the most proud Cardassian how much of their survival is due to the efforts of a Bajoran freedom fighter, Kira Nerys.One of the first actions taken by the reformed Detapa Council was to make a formal apology to the people of Bajor, and a promise of reparations once Cardassian society was capable. This might have been received quite coldly, except for the words of Kira. She argued to the Council of Ministers that the Cardassian people, and Cardassian society, had received their punishment already.Her testimony of the ways in which Cardassians had suffered, and the extent of the suffering, swayed not only the Ministers, but much of Bajoran society. Many began to view the Cardassian people not as evil, but as being victims of their out-of-control military almost as much as the Bajorans had been, an analogy that Kira herself made.Because of this, the apology was accepted, but the offer of reparations was officially rejected by the Bajoran government. Their response was that any help such reparations might have provided to Bajor had already been taken care of by the Federation, and that instead the Bajorans would help the Federation in doing the same for Cardassian culture.Such help from a people that many Cardassians were aware of having suffered so brutally at their hands, a people that were not Cardassian, was one of the turning points in the rebuilding of Cardassian society.Today, Cardassia and Bajor are each the second largest populations of their respective species outside of their homeworlds, and there is extensive trade between the two. Many Cardassians have become fascinated by the Bajoran religion of the Prophets, and many Bajorans have become fascinated by the talent for art that many Cardassians have, especially when most Bajorans grew up believing that the only talent Cardassians had was brutality.Near the end of the occupation period, when Bajor was admitted to the Federation, some Cardassians began to suggest that Cardassia should also ask to join the Federation. The argument was that the Federation was already there rebuilding their society, and perhaps the way forward was the Federation to simply not leave.While this idea was considered more warily by some Cardassians, very few were vehemently opposed to it. Even so, Cardassian leadership, Bajoran advisors, and the Federation itself all argued against it.Cardassian leadership argued that the Cardassian people hadn’t ever really had the chance to figure out who they were as a people, and they needed to do this before such a thing could be considered.Bajoran leadership argued that the Cardassian people were in the same situation the Bajorans had been, and that it was important that they saw themselves stand on their own feet before making such a decision. They said that they understood and sympathized with the idea, because many on Bajor had felt the same way when the Cardassians had left and the Federation had stepped in. But they said that now they see how valuable it had been to stand on their own for a while first.The Federation argued that while they would be happy to provide whatever humanitarian assistance was necessary, there were simply too many fresh wounds that needed time to heal. The Federation Council privately told the Cardassian leadership that it was unlikely the Cardassian people would be given a fair consideration be some of its members if the request was made so soon, and that further, some members of the Federation would feel it was too much like conquering and annexing Cardassia.Cardassian society now finds itself in a stable if somewhat raw state, ready to venture out with new perspective for the first time since becoming warp capable.The final efforts of the Voyager crew with regard to the Borg are highly classified. What is commonly understood among the rank-and-file is that the Borg were dealt a severe blow, and that the Federation considers any incursion by the Borg for the foreseeable future to be unlikely.Even so, Starfleet crews and ships are still designed and trained with conflict with the Borg in mind, and though the details are known to only a select few, it is apparent to many within Starfleet that the technologies to deal with the Borg are still in active development.The status of Seven of Nine, and her existence is now widely known throughout all of the Federation, and consequently throughout the quadrant. However, whether because she has been instructed not to or because she does not wish to, she has never publicly commented on the Borg or her experiences with them.Only two further contacts with the Dominion have been made since the end of the war and the return of Odo to The Great Link. The first contact came in 2375 only weeks after the war had ended and was a more formal accounting of the parameters of surrender the Federation was imposing on the Dominion. These included prohibiting any Dominion forces from entering the Alpha Quadrant by any means, and the requirement for any Changelings who enter the Alpha Quadrant to stop at Deep Space Nine to notify the Federation of their intended destination and purpose.As an enforcement measure, the Federation imposed a mandatory search for Changelings of any vessel returning through the wormhole for at least the next 10 years. This extraordinary measure would not normally have been palatable to the Federation, but the war had been so vast and so destructive that not only Federation citizens, but even the Klingons and Romulans saw the wisdom of allowing the Federation to search all vessels returning from the Gamma Quadrant.Since neither the Romulans nor the Klingons trusted each other to not use their cloaking technology to try and evade these searches, Deep Space Nine was provided with advanced cloak scanning technology by them. This technology was provided in a closed system that was not open for study to Federation engineers, and Klingon or Romulan personnel have had to visit to maintain it any time it has suffered a malfunction.According to the agreement signed by the three governments, the technology is only ever used if the wormhole opens with no apparent ship transit. Further, all three governments are provided the results of all searches, including those done using the cloak scanning technology.The Federation did decide however to allow commerce and civilian traffic through the wormhole, no matter who it came from, deciding to operate Deep Space Nine as something like a freeport. Normal Federation import laws would not apply to Deep Space Nine unless the cargo was purely military in nature, or the destination for the cargo was within the Federation.The Dominion was surprised by this concession by the Federation, considering that they had surrendered unconditionally to save the Changelings from extinction. Over the last five years, commerce has slowly but surely increased, and this combined with the newfound understanding the Link obtained from Odo, has convinced the Dominion that it may actually be possible to maintain relations with some solids as equals at some point in the future.The second contact between the Federation and the Dominion came in 2377. It involved setting up a subspace link through the wormhole to enable open communication between the two powers in the future, and the construction effort for this relay was still underway, being hesitantly constructed from both sides.For the time being, the Dominion has remained within their borders and mostly silent.Little contact had been made with the Breen prior to the war, but the attack on Earth ensured that they were a prominent species in the mind of the Federation after the war ended. Their remaining ships retreated back to Breen space, ignoring all demands and efforts at contact from the Federation. Though many suggested that the Breen could simply be allowed to “go home without consequences”, no one was willing to immediately mount a campaign of aggression into Breen space.The Breen have remained conspicuously silent since the end of the war, even cutting off trade with the Ferengi, and seemingly every other species that the Federation has contact with. Starfleet Command remains very concerned about the reasons for this and about possible future conflict with the Breen, and their technology is being actively studied by Starfleet to prepare for the possibility of a conflict in the future.For the moment however, they seem to have retreated into isolation.In some ways Ferengi culture has changed radically. The impact of Rom becoming the Grand Nagus cannot be overstated, and Ferengi society has become far more equal among men and women. There has also been an emphasis from Rom on “long-term profits”, and how duplicitous business results in fewer business opportunities in the future.In other ways though, the Ferengi remain the Ferengi. While Ferengi privateers and plots remain a consistent problem for the Federation, their frequency has declined, and their scope is generally smaller. The Federation is not aware of any efforts to steal a Starfleet ship since the end of the war, although several thefts of Federation designed civilian ships have occurred.In general, the Ferengi seem to be holding up their end of agreements more frequently, and they have been the largest benefactors of the Federation policies regarding Deep Space Nine and the Gamma Quadrant following the war.]]></description><link>lore/the-galaxy-in-2385.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Lore/The Galaxy in 2385.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 10:15:30 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
