With warp-speed rendered impossible and subspace communications completely washed out by background subspace frequencies in the system, an away was sent down to Bacchus-3 to investigate the source of the distortion waves. There, a small coalition team of Starfleet and Klingon officers seemed entranced by the giant monoliths sticking out of the surface of the planet.

First, an away team would return to the planet to investigate the facility, hoping to find an off switch. At the same time, a team on the Hyperion would attempt to outfit the starship to escape the Bacchus system by riding the Subspace wave out. The away team disabled the security system at the entrance to the monolith and navigated to the control room at the center. There a computer system informed them that the Facility was built to contained something or someone called The Displaced. Verlath was able to recognize genetic codes in the displays with telltale signs of modifications.In the end, the team disabled the subspace distortion wave, which triggered an emergency response from the facility. A breadbox sized artifact that the computer described as a \"key\" was revealed, which the away team took with them. The planet produced a massive tractor beam and pulled the planet Bacchus-2 out of orbit. It began using the rocky material of the planet to create new Monoliths.On the Hyperion, Buchanon and SILAR worked to integrate SILAR more deeply into the ship's control systems. The ship's sensors were connected directly to the nacelles to respond more quickly to changes in subspace. And SILAR's decision making processes were set as the control point for ship. SILAR was able to respond more quickly to changes in the gravitational profile of the system. Rhen Gorath piloted the waverider to meet with the Hyperion, and they all warped out of the system, back to Narendra Station.Admiral Banna Stoker debriefed the team on Narendra Station, and took the artifact for study, assigning science officer Kassandra Pruitt to investigate.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 2 - Imminent Collision.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 2 - Imminent Collision.md\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/groups/hyperion/shared/mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-2-imminent-collision.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 2 - Imminent Collision</a>: Stardate 62078.6The Hyperion made first contact with a new species made of crystal that communicated with refracted light.

They found a strange crystalline starship and started rudimentary and cooperative communication with it.The crew found an unidentified torpedo lodged into the side of the crystalline structure, seemingly made just for the purpose of attacking this kind of starship. As the hull of the ship seemed to be a living entity of some sort, Verlath organized a surgical transport procedure to remove the torpedo safely.Once the torpedo was removed, the aliens in the ship revealed themselves: strange crystal beings who communicated through light refraction.

There a Romulan Warbird decloaked to prevent the Hyperion from taking the artifact.After the first contact with the crystalline starship, Cmdr. Gorath and SILAR spent much of their time working on deciphering the light-based language they communicated with, making some progress on terms used during the mission. Buchanan made a deal with Nax to take a crate of stem bolts off the station.Verlath was brought into the sick bay to help stabilize Kassandra Pruitt, whose neurological functions were suddenly declining after a research project with the Bacchus Artifact. Soon after, the artifact was stolen, and the crew of the Hyperion recruited to help track it down. Collectively, they narrowed the options down to an Orion ship, the SS Castle Rock, that had left the station shortly after the theft.The Hyperion was sent in pursuit of the Castle Rock before it could get to the neutral zone, but was not fast enough. There, the Castle Rock was found disabled: the back section crushed in by some gravitational field coming from the artifact. The Orion captain Paljara refused to hand over the artifact and warned the Hyperion to flee. When they didn't, a Romulan Bird of Prey decloaked and announced their intention to \"protect\" the Orion vessel, who had been given passage rights. They also sent engineers aboard the Orion freighter to provide assistance with repairs.Verlath was able to disguise the life signs of Enat Tara and himself. They beamed aboard the Orion vessel along with SILAR to recover the artifact as quickly as possible. Two Orions were beamed from the Castle Rock into the Hyperion's brig to keep the number of life signs consistent.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2.md\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/groups/hyperion/shared/mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.2-orion-heist-part-2.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2</a>: Stardate 62098An away team from the Hyperion stormed the Orion freighter and recovered the Bacchus Artifact. In their wake, a disabled Orion freighter and potential casualties.SILAR, Verlath, Enat Tara, and Ensign Eric boarded the Orion freighter to recover the Bacchus Artifact. SILAR assumed an Orion disguise and eavesdropped on an argument between the Orion captain Paljara and some Romulan officers. She seemed distressed and was unable to explain to the officers why a crew member was interfaced with the artifact.Meanwhile, Verlath, Enat, and Eric moved to the other side of the ship to retrieve the artifact. The plan was to meet back in the middle and beam out without anyone knowing the wiser. They followed a Orion pirate to the cargo hold, where they saw 1 Orion interfaced with the Bacchus Artifact using a neural net.Unfortunately, Enat lost his temper with Verlath and his raised voice alerted some Orion pirates in the destroyed cargo hold. While Enat laid down supressing fire and held back the Romulans at the other end of the ship, Ensign Eric shot an explosive barrel in the cargo hold. This took out 3 Orions, one of whcih was the one interfaced with the artidfact. The artifact was thrown across the room by the explosion.During this fight, Captain Paljara hailed the Hyperion and begged Rhen Gorath to let them go with the artifiact. Paljara explained that her sister was beingheld by the Romulans and that the artifact was her ransom. Without it, her sister may be killed.Verlath ran across to grab it, but was beaten there by a pirate, who was then stunned. Verlath brought the artifact towards the Orion previously interfaced with it and set up pattern enhancers to beam out. The away team regrouped at the pattern engancer and beamed out.Meanwhile, Rhen Gorath had been engaging in debate and discussion with te Romulan sub-commander Thal'vaek. Commander Gorath was attempting to distract Thal'vaek until the away team could make it back to the Hyperion, and Thal'vaek was similarly trying to buy his officers time while they recovered the artifact. Thal'vaek challenged Gorath on their place in Starfleet, suggesting that all officers are just tools for government powers.When the away team returned with the artifact, Thal'vaek found out what had happened and ordered his ship to fire on the Hyperion. The Hyperion was able to warp out of the neutral zone quickly while taking damage to their shields.Back on Narendra Station, Admiral Banna Stoker congratulated the crew of the Hyperion and asked for the Artifact to be returned to the lab for her to inspect later. She dismissed concerns about the Orion casualties and declined to organize a rescue mission for Paljara's sister, potentially somewhere in Romulan space.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 4 - Peas to Meet You.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 4 - Peas to Meet You.md\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/groups/hyperion/shared/mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-4-peas-to-meet-you.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 4 - Peas to Meet You</a>: Stardate 62139The Hyperion assisted the USS Constantine in delivering a crucial agricultural exchange to a colony in the Yacci system.

A boarding party from the Hyperion found the crew of the Constantine acting strangely. The Executive officer seemed paranoid that someone was trying to assassinate the captain. The Captain was engaged in some sort of wrestling tournament, and various other crew members were exhibiting strong emotional reactions to things around them.When Buchanon went to engineering and found the chief engineer being consoled by a civilian from Re-Alpha, he were eating some ice peas, a fruit local to Re-Alpha. Scans found traces of tetraflouride-4, a neurotoxin which would cause different reactions from each person as a stress response. They tracked down the source of this neurotoxin to a plan on board called Ice Peas. The crop had been removed from it's natural habitat and was creating this neurotoxin in response to losing a particular fungus in it's soil. SILAR and Verlath were able to create a virus that were rewrite the genome of the Ice Pea bush to block its ability to produce tetraflouride-4. With the neurotoxin neutralized, the colony would be able to continue to Yacci and complete it's mission.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 5 - The Pasqual Problem.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 5 - The Pasqual Problem.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-5-the-pasqual-problem.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 5 - The Pasqual Problem</a>: Stardate 62172Admiral Banna Stoker joined the hyperion after being attacked in the Shackleton Expanse, and ordered them to head to the Pasqual system.
