Inspired by the return of Voyager (common knowledge, but the details of how are top secret), The Federation is looking forward to a new age of exploration further than they've ever gone before. From a reddit post <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/hsl9nh/a_setting_overview_for_2380/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/hsl9nh/a_setting_overview_for_2380/\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.\nThe adventure starts in the year 2379, 1 year after the USS Voyager returned to Earth, and 3 years after the conclusion of the Dominion War. The Alpha and Beta Quadrants are in an uneasy but stable peace.The Romulans are more wary and less arrogant in regard to the Federation. They have somehow become aware of actions Section 31 took to end the Dominion War, and contrary to the horror Federation leadership had when they learned of it, the Romulans seem to have taken it as a sign that they have gravely underestimated the Federation.From their perspective, the Federation encountered a civilization that attempted to subvert them and subjugate them in the Dominion, and instead of taking the expected actions by conceding everything one piece at a time until it was all lost, the Federation prompted direct confrontation by mining the wormhole and actively attacking their opponent’s logistical support.Once the war had begun, the Federation was able to somehow not only convince the Klingons to fight at their side, but to do so at the direction of Starfleet, which the Romulan government found to be a totally incredulous idea. A Starfleet captain had orchestrated the assassination of a Romulan Senator in order to manipulate them into fighting at the Federation’s side as well! Finally, the Federation showed a willingness to engage in total war when existentially threatened.Limited trade, and the continuation of the Neutral Zone as well as the Treaty of Algeron, will maintain the status quo while the Romulans put in effort to modernize and update their fleet and empire.The Klingons have become much closer to the Federation since the victory over the Cardassians and the Dominion. Many within the Houses have suggested that the consistency of honor in battle by Starfleet is a sign of a worthy ally, and that the empire should seek to continue the friendly relationship it now has with Starfleet and the Federation.This is at odds with the renewed thirst for battle that Klingon society is experiencing, however it is obvious now that the Federation would make terrible enemies if direct conflict happened, and it is unlikely that the Federation would stand by should the Klingon Empire seek to expand once again, even if it wasn’t near the Federation.Klingon society also depends heavily at this point on dilithium imports from the Federation, and their society has become far too economically tied to the Federation for open conflict to be anything except painful.Some Klingons suggest that in primarily exploring, the average Starfleet vessel encounters more battle than the average Klingon vessel does. Because of this, there is a growing sentiment that a Klingon who joins Starfleet has a better chance of finding glory than a Klingon who serves the empire. Some have even suggested that the empire should join the Federation and find glory in defending it against the many foes it has, some of which are quite formidable such as the Borg.This sentiment is not yet widespread, and though it is talked about by many Klingons, it is always in hushed voices. There have been many more Klingons who have joined Starfleet however, and while some were unable to make it in an environment where they needed to respect and follow the orders of non-Klingon superiors, others have found their lives to be much better and more fulfilling.There is also the risk of the thirst for battle being turned inward. Without a good path to conquer other societies, and with the conflict in opinion about the Federation, the stability of the Klingon Empire is threatened, and it is possible that a civil war may break out over cooperation with the Federation. This would be just as much due to their thirst for battle having no viable outlet as it would be to the disagreement itself.Utterly ruined by the war, Cardassian society totally collapsed due to the conflict. During the post-war occupation by the Federation, Klingons, and Romulans, Cardassian society was transformed. The common Cardassian was opened to the idea that while their loyalty had always been to the state, the state’s loyalty hadn’t always been to them.The catastrophic loss of life left the people open to new ideas, and during the four years of occupation and rebuilding (which ended officially in 2379), Bajoran society was perhaps ironically a huge influence on Cardassia.Cardassians now have a nascent society which values the art and culture of their people. They are all aware of just how close their society and culture came to extermination at the hands of either the Dominion or the Alliance forces, and there is an existential need among Cardassians to show that their culture is one worth preserving. That it is better for everyone that they didn’t die to the last man.The Detapa Council has been remade, but in a move that would have been unthinkable only a decade ago, most of its members are now elected by the people. In addition to the elected members, the council has two members that are elected by members of the military, one member who is elected by members of the remade Obsidian order, and one more member who is elected by Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory. This, combined with the five members elected by the Cardassian public, make up the nine people who make up the council.A large number of Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory live on Bajor, which is to some ironic. However, it is obvious to even the most proud Cardassian how much of their survival is due to the efforts of a Bajoran freedom fighter, Kira Nerys.One of the first actions taken by the reformed Detapa Council was to make a formal apology to the people of Bajor, and a promise of reparations once Cardassian society was capable. This might have been received quite coldly, except for the words of Kira. She argued to the Council of Ministers that the Cardassian people, and Cardassian society, had received their punishment already.Her testimony of the ways in which Cardassians had suffered, and the extent of the suffering, swayed not only the Ministers, but much of Bajoran society. Many began to view the Cardassian people not as evil, but as being victims of their out-of-control military almost as much as the Bajorans had been, an analogy that Kira herself made.Because of this, the apology was accepted, but the offer of reparations was officially rejected by the Bajoran government. Their response was that any help such reparations might have provided to Bajor had already been taken care of by the Federation, and that instead the Bajorans would help the Federation in doing the same for Cardassian culture.Such help from a people that many Cardassians were aware of having suffered so brutally at their hands, a people that were not Cardassian, was one of the turning points in the rebuilding of Cardassian society.Today, Cardassia and Bajor are each the second largest populations of their respective species outside of their homeworlds, and there is extensive trade between the two. Many Cardassians have become fascinated by the Bajoran religion of the Prophets, and many Bajorans have become fascinated by the talent for art that many Cardassians have, especially when most Bajorans grew up believing that the only talent Cardassians had was brutality.Near the end of the occupation period, when Bajor was admitted to the Federation, some Cardassians began to suggest that Cardassia should also ask to join the Federation. The argument was that the Federation was already there rebuilding their society, and perhaps the way forward was the Federation to simply not leave.While this idea was considered more warily by some Cardassians, very few were vehemently opposed to it. Even so, Cardassian leadership, Bajoran advisors, and the Federation itself all argued against it.Cardassian leadership argued that the Cardassian people hadn’t ever really had the chance to figure out who they were as a people, and they needed to do this before such a thing could be considered.Bajoran leadership argued that the Cardassian people were in the same situation the Bajorans had been, and that it was important that they saw themselves stand on their own feet before making such a decision. They said that they understood and sympathized with the idea, because many on Bajor had felt the same way when the Cardassians had left and the Federation had stepped in. But they said that now they see how valuable it had been to stand on their own for a while first.The Federation argued that while they would be happy to provide whatever humanitarian assistance was necessary, there were simply too many fresh wounds that needed time to heal. The Federation Council privately told the Cardassian leadership that it was unlikely the Cardassian people would be given a fair consideration be some of its members if the request was made so soon, and that further, some members of the Federation would feel it was too much like conquering and annexing Cardassia.Cardassian society now finds itself in a stable if somewhat raw state, ready to venture out with new perspective for the first time since becoming warp capable.The final efforts of the Voyager crew with regard to the Borg are highly classified. What is commonly understood among the rank-and-file is that the Borg were dealt a severe blow, and that the Federation considers any incursion by the Borg for the foreseeable future to be unlikely.Even so, Starfleet crews and ships are still designed and trained with conflict with the Borg in mind, and though the details are known to only a select few, it is apparent to many within Starfleet that the technologies to deal with the Borg are still in active development.The status of Seven of Nine, and her existence is now widely known throughout all of the Federation, and consequently throughout the quadrant. However, whether because she has been instructed not to or because she does not wish to, she has never publicly commented on the Borg or her experiences with them.Only two further contacts with the Dominion have been made since the end of the war and the return of Odo to The Great Link. The first contact came in 2375 only weeks after the war had ended and was a more formal accounting of the parameters of surrender the Federation was imposing on the Dominion. These included prohibiting any Dominion forces from entering the Alpha Quadrant by any means, and the requirement for any Changelings who enter the Alpha Quadrant to stop at Deep Space Nine to notify the Federation of their intended destination and purpose.As an enforcement measure, the Federation imposed a mandatory search for Changelings of any vessel returning through the wormhole for at least the next 10 years. This extraordinary measure would not normally have been palatable to the Federation, but the war had been so vast and so destructive that not only Federation citizens, but even the Klingons and Romulans saw the wisdom of allowing the Federation to search all vessels returning from the Gamma Quadrant.Since neither the Romulans nor the Klingons trusted each other to not use their cloaking technology to try and evade these searches, Deep Space Nine was provided with advanced cloak scanning technology by them. This technology was provided in a closed system that was not open for study to Federation engineers, and Klingon or Romulan personnel have had to visit to maintain it any time it has suffered a malfunction.According to the agreement signed by the three governments, the technology is only ever used if the wormhole opens with no apparent ship transit. Further, all three governments are provided the results of all searches, including those done using the cloak scanning technology.The Federation did decide however to allow commerce and civilian traffic through the wormhole, no matter who it came from, deciding to operate Deep Space Nine as something like a freeport. Normal Federation import laws would not apply to Deep Space Nine unless the cargo was purely military in nature, or the destination for the cargo was within the Federation.The Dominion was surprised by this concession by the Federation, considering that they had surrendered unconditionally to save the Changelings from extinction. Over the last five years, commerce has slowly but surely increased, and this combined with the newfound understanding the Link obtained from Odo, has convinced the Dominion that it may actually be possible to maintain relations with some solids as equals at some point in the future.The second contact between the Federation and the Dominion came in 2377. It involved setting up a subspace link through the wormhole to enable open communication between the two powers in the future, and the construction effort for this relay was still underway, being hesitantly constructed from both sides.For the time being, the Dominion has remained within their borders and mostly silent.Little contact had been made with the Breen prior to the war, but the attack on Earth ensured that they were a prominent species in the mind of the Federation after the war ended. Their remaining ships retreated back to Breen space, ignoring all demands and efforts at contact from the Federation. Though many suggested that the Breen could simply be allowed to “go home without consequences”, no one was willing to immediately mount a campaign of aggression into Breen space.The Breen have remained conspicuously silent since the end of the war, even cutting off trade with the Ferengi, and seemingly every other species that the Federation has contact with. Starfleet Command remains very concerned about the reasons for this and about possible future conflict with the Breen, and their technology is being actively studied by Starfleet to prepare for the possibility of a conflict in the future.For the moment however, they seem to have retreated into isolation.In some ways Ferengi culture has changed radically. The impact of Rom becoming the Grand Nagus cannot be overstated, and Ferengi society has become far more equal among men and women. There has also been an emphasis from Rom on “long-term profits”, and how duplicitous business results in fewer business opportunities in the future.In other ways though, the Ferengi remain the Ferengi. While Ferengi privateers and plots remain a consistent problem for the Federation, their frequency has declined, and their scope is generally smaller. The Federation is not aware of any efforts to steal a Starfleet ship since the end of the war, although several thefts of Federation designed civilian ships have occurred.In general, the Ferengi seem to be holding up their end of agreements more frequently, and they have been the largest benefactors of the Federation policies regarding Deep Space Nine and the Gamma Quadrant following the war.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Timeline","level":2,"id":"Timeline_0"},{"heading":"The Romulans","level":2,"id":"The_Romulans_0"},{"heading":"The Klingons","level":2,"id":"The_Klingons_0"},{"heading":"The Cardassians","level":2,"id":"The_Cardassians_0"},{"heading":"The Borg","level":2,"id":"The_Borg_0"},{"heading":"The Dominion","level":2,"id":"The_Dominion_0"},{"heading":"The Breen","level":2,"id":"The_Breen_0"},{"heading":"The Ferengi","level":2,"id":"The_Ferengi_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"lore/the-galaxy-in-2379.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1745850846943,"modifiedTime":1750685319977,"sourceSize":16159,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Lore/The Galaxy in 2379.md","exportPath":"lore/the-galaxy-in-2379.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"lore/the-shackleton-expanse.html":{"title":"The Shackleton Expanse","icon":"","description":"The Shackleton ExpanseFar from the heart of the Federation lies the Shackleton Expanse, a massive area of space deep within the Beta Quadrant.

She has informed us that it is projected to make contact with the station in about 8 hours, and all scans are inconclusive. While the entity isn't cloaked, it is difficult to scan, refracting all scans of emitted by the Starbase around it so that we are unable to get a reading of what this is or what its intentions are. While the Klingons want to shoot this entity down, our mission is to attempt to divert this entity or stop it before it collides with the station. There may be life forms involved, and the last thing that we want to do is make first contact with a species by killing a ship full of them, if that is what's out there.We have arrived at the entity and deduced it is a ship of some kind. It appears to be alive and populated by some kind of non-corporeal life forms. While they did not respond to our hails, Lt. Buchanan and Lt. Cmdr. Silar were able to engage the ship in a rudimentary pattern recognition and response based on pulses of light from our deflector array. They repeated the pattern back to us, and after determining that this was indicative of some form of intelligence, were able to use the language we gathered from the Obelisks on Bacchus-III and the oldest recorded variants of the El-Aurian language to transmit a simple message to the ship: STOP. They complied with the request and then the ship began to roll over and show us its underside, like an injured Kata would do on Trill when showing someone where it was hurt. Scans revealed some damage to the vessel in this region, and there appears to be an unexploded torpedo of some kind. Myself, Lt. Cmdr. Silar, Dr. Verlath, and Lt. Buchanan will take a shuttle to the crystalline vessel and see if there is a way that we can help it to remove the ordinance from it's body, for lack of a better word.Silar and Buchanan were able to successfully disarm the torpedo, removing the risk of it exploding and further damaging or destroying the crystalline vessel. Dr. Verlath and I coordinated as best as we could to remove the device and also supplement the walls where it had damaged the vessel. While we were unable to keep all the walls intact, we were able to successfully remove the torpedo from the vessel. While it has warped away from the station, I doubt this is the last we've seen of it. We have made some progress in communication with the crystalline vessel and the non-corporeal beings who reside inside of it, but there is still work to be done. We have returned to the Starbase and provided the torpedo to Admiral Stoker and her teams for further study, and are awaiting our orders while we try to figure out the mystery behind both Bacchus-III and this crystalline vessel.Who are these people? Why has no one made contact with them yet? And what is behind the the washboard effect both in the region and the localized one emanating from Bacchus-III? All we can do is keep doing our jobs and living by our principles, trusting that the answers will reveal themselves along the way.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[{"heading":"First Officer's Log - 62078.6","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log_-_62078.6_0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log, Supplemental: ","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log,_Supplemental__0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log, Supplemental: ","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log,_Supplemental__1"}],"links":["mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-2-imminent-collision.html#_0","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-2.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1747844378542,"modifiedTime":1747846624665,"sourceSize":3463,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Logs/Rhen Gorath Log 2.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-2.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.1-the-orion-incident.html":{"title":"Rhen Gorath Log 3.1 - The Orion Incident","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Hyperion Log 3.1 - Orion Heist Part 1\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.1-orion-heist-part-1.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 3.1 - Orion Heist Part 1</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Rhen Gorath\" href=\"crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rhen Gorath</a>\nStardate:: 62098Log:: After some time working with SILAR to decipher the light based language of the crystalline ship, Admiral Stoker has called the Senior Staff of the Hyperion to a briefing where she informed us that the artifact we recovered from Bacchus-III had been taken. It was not clear at the time of the briefing who had taken the artifact and whether or not it was still present on the station. Our mission is to recover the artifact at all costs.While I do not disagree was to the importance of the artifact, this does make me wonder if there is something about this artifact that is being kept secret from us. Time will tell, however, we are beginning our investigation with all haste, and I hope that whomever has absconded with the artifact has not yet left the station.After a frustrating number of dead ends and red herrings, to borrow a phrase from my human colleagues, we have determined that it was the Orions who have made off with the artifact. The SS Castle Rock is commanded by Captain Paljara, and we have charted their course on a path to the Neutral Zone.Despite the best efforts from our ship and crew, we were unable to intercept the Castle Rock in time and found ourselves pursuing them into the Neutral Zone. While this is technically a violation of the treaty between The Federation and The Romulan Star Empire, we have been ordered to recover this artifact at all costs, and that is what we will do.When we finally caught up to the Castle Rock, it was too late. She was disabled, with the aft section of the ship crushed by a gravimetric field emanating from the artifact. Captain Paljara refused to allow us to recover the artifact or help her, and it was at this point we found ourselves face to face with a D'deridex Class Warbird. Subcommander Thal'vaek informed us that the Castle Rock was under their protection and transported over engineers to assist with the repairs.The quick thinking of Dr. Verlath allowed him to disguise the life signs of himself, Lieutenant Commander Tara, and Ensign Eric Jimothy, and they were beamed over along with Silar to endeavor to recover the artifact, while we simultaneously beamed over three Orions in order to not alert the crew of the Castle Rock that the number of life signs had changed.Meanwhile, I am staying behind on the ship with Captain Cerjaso to ensure that we're able to keep a tricky situation from getting out of hand.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[{"heading":"First Officer's Log - Stardate 62098:","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log_-_Stardate_62098_0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log - Supplemental:","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log_-_Supplemental_0"}],"links":["mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.1-orion-heist-part-1.html#_0","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.1-the-orion-incident.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750147286403,"modifiedTime":1750147536265,"sourceSize":2687,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Logs/Rhen Gorath Log 3.1 - The Orion Incident.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.1-the-orion-incident.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.2-the-orion-incident.html":{"title":"Rhen Gorath Log 3.2 - The Orion Incident","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.2-orion-heist-part-2.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Rhen Gorath\" href=\"crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rhen Gorath</a>\nStardate:: 62098Log:: It's always a game of chess with the Romulans, and this time was no different. I engaged in a lengthy discussion with the Subcommander in order to buy our crew time to recover the artifact, and I have no illusions that he was not doing the same thing.After some reconnaissance, the away team was able to locate the artifact, as well as find out that there was an Orion who had interfaced with said artifact. A firefight broke out, and while it was not necessarily how I would have recommended we play out this attack, Ensign Jimothy seems to have turned the tide in the firefight by targeting an explosive barrel. Unfortunately, this resulted in 3 casualties onboard the Orion vessel.Captain Paljara hailed us and begged us to allow them to escape with the artifact, which we were unable to do. She informed us that her sister had been captured by the Romulans, and if we didn't let her go with it, they were going to kill her. However, we were unable to help her in this manner. We did offer to assist in any other way we could with her sister, which she seemed to dismiss out of hand.The away team returned quickly to the vessel, and Subcommander Thal'vaek ordered his vessel to fire on the Hyperion. Thanks to Lieutenants Buchanan and th'Kerre, we were able to get to warp and high tail it back to Narendra Station with our shields up, taking minor damage to our shields before escaping the Neutral Zone.Upon our return, Admiral Stoker congratulated us on a job well done and requested the return of the artifact for inspection and evaluation. Shockingly, she declined to allow us to engage in any sort of mission to help Captain Paljara and her sister. There is something that isn't quite right here. I can't put my finger on it, but her behavior strikes me as nothing short of suspicious.Additionally, I don't believe I've seen the last of Captain Paljara, and when we do see each other again, I don't believe we'll find ourselves on the best of terms, given this exchange.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[{"heading":"First Officer's Log - Supplemental:","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log_-_Supplemental_0"}],"links":["mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.2-orion-heist-part-2.html#_0","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.2-the-orion-incident.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750147552657,"modifiedTime":1750147624024,"sourceSize":2233,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Logs/Rhen Gorath Log 3.2 - The Orion Incident.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.2-the-orion-incident.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-4-peas-to-meet-you.html":{"title":"Rhen Gorath Log 4 - Peas to Meet You","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Hyperion Log 4 - Peas to Meet You\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-4-peas-to-meet-you.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 4 - Peas to Meet You</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Rhen Gorath\" href=\"crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rhen Gorath</a>\nStardate:: 62139Log:: We received a report that the USS Constantine, a Galaxy Class Starship, has not reported in. The Constantine was in the process of transporting a group of 300 colonists from Re-Alpha to Yacci along with some agricultural crops native to Re-Alpha. We intercepted Constantine still moving along its path but traveling at warp. After hailing the vessel, we found the Captain was not on the bridge, but instead were answered by Commander Sytok, who indicated was in command of the vessel and appeared quite paranoid, which is extremely odd behavior for a Vulcan.Myself, SILAR, Dr. Verlath, Lieutenant Buchanan, and Lieutenant Commander Enat Tara beamed over to the ship, cautious and ready to investigate this mystery.Upon beaming over, we eventually were able to meet up with Commander Sytok, whose paranoia seemed exacerbated by our presence. He was concerned that someone was attempting to assassinate their Captain, whom we found engaged in some sort of wrestling or martial arts competition. While not as extreme as Anbo-Jitsu, it was nonetheless fraught with danger.While I conversed with the Commander, Dr. Verlath scanned him and was able to determine that he had been exposed to a compound known as Tetraflouride-4, which is a neurotoxin that induces stress responses in those who are exposed to it.We split up in order to gain more information about this neurotixin, and Dr. Verlath was able to devise an antidote that, at least temporarily, would counteract this neurotoxin so that Commander Sytok was able to work with Dr. Verlath and SILAR in order to better understand what the cause of this was.In Engineering, Buchanan found that a particular crop, known as an Ice Pea, was being consumed by those onboard as part of the equivalent of what those on earth might have called a county fair, and in being removed from it's natural environment, the neurotoxin was allowed to fester rather than being removed by the natural processes of the soil.Having determined the source of the neurotoxin, we began work to neutralize it. While we all endeavored to not consume the plant or its derivatives despite the protestations of those who offered it to us, most of us were able to resist. The exception was Lieutenant Buchanan, who was forced into a scenario where he was unable to avoid consuming the plant. He found himself wondering into the Brig and released a group of crew who had refused to consume the Ice Peas and subsequently had been locked up.Dr. Verlath and SILAR were able to create a retrovirus which rewrote the Genome of the Ice Pease, isolating and removing the Tetraflouride-4 from the plant, doing the job of the native fungus on Re-Alpha which had a symbiotic relationship with the Ice Pea Plant. After neutralizing the toxin in both the plants and the crew, Constantine was able to resume its mission to Yacci and bring the colonists to their new home.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[{"heading":"First Officer's Log - Stardate 62138:","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log_-_Stardate_62138_0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log, Supplemental","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log,_Supplemental_0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log, Supplemental","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log,_Supplemental_1"}],"links":["mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-4-peas-to-meet-you.html#_0","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-4-peas-to-meet-you.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1752792347382,"modifiedTime":1752792508690,"sourceSize":3211,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Logs/Rhen Gorath Log 4 - Peas to Meet You.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-4-peas-to-meet-you.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html":{"title":"Rhen Gorath Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Hyperion Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Rhen Gorath\" href=\"crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rhen Gorath</a>\nStardate:: 62172Log:: During a routine survey mission in The Shackleton Expanse, our crew was alerted to a small craft careening toward us at Warp 5. We were hailed by the commander of the vessel, who turned out to be none other than Admiral Banna Stoker. She was disheveled, and and examination of the runabout she was piloting showed us that it had been in a fight. There appeared to be damage from some sort of rail gun type projectile to the runabout, and Admiral Stoker was quite vague with the information that she was willing to give us.We were ordered to proceed straight to a set of coordinates that she provided us at maximum warp, and to maintain radio silence throughout our journey. In addition, Admiral Stoker was in possession of The Artifact that had been recovered from Bacchus-III and stolen by the Orions, which we recovered.After some encouragement from Dr. Verlath and myself, we escorted the Admiral to the Observation Lounge and were able to persuade her to allow us to set up a containment field around the artifact to protect all of us from the effects that we had seen perpetrated by this object in the past. We arrived at Pasqual-I, and I used my access codes to view the Admiral's logs. She had been in the Expanse for about a week and visited two planets, and Pasqual-I was not among them. Her logs confirm that she was attacked by an unidentified vessel.Upon meeting with the Admiral in the Observation lounge, she informed us that Starfleet Command was worried about the Romulan interest in the artifact and that they might use it as a weapon. Her orders continued to be vague.The Admiral was checked out by Dr. Verlath and did pass the medical exam, but something appears to still be off about her behavior and demeanor.Pasqual-I is an archipelago, with numerous smaller obelisks on the planet similar to what was found on Bacchus-III, albeit smaller, only 3-4 stories in height. The islands appear to be situated in a manner that is similar to the ancient continent of Pangea, found on Earth.I continue to be full of reservations about this mission. The Admiral has ordered us to beam down to the planet and make contact, however, there is zero indication that these people have achieved anything remotely like Warp Drive, Space Flight, or event flight, as the 800 million inhabitants seem to be in the early industrial period. I spoke to Captain Kala about my reservations and was able to persuade her to speak to the Admiral.Before she could make her way to the Admiral, a ship powered by what appears to be some sort of solar sail dropped out of warp and hailed us. They are an unknown species, but identify themselves as the Vinshari. They indicated they wanted to board us and retrieve the artifact. Obviously, there was no way we could allow this to occur at present, and the Vinshari opened fire with the same type of railgun weapon that attacked the Admiral's runabout.After they caused severe damage to our ship and systems, we were able to repair our shields and SILAR created a sensor echo meant to distract the Vinshari and allow us to gain the upper hand. After a volley of attacks, we successfully disabled their shields and hailed the Vinshari vessel. At this point, Admiral Stoker ordered us to fire and the Captain confined her to quarters. She threatened us with a court-martial, but if I am to be court-martialed for staying true to the ideals of The Federation, so be it.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[{"heading":"First Officer's Log, Stardate 62158.5","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log,_Stardate_62158.5_0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log, Supplemental","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log,_Supplemental_0"}],"links":["mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html#_0","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1752792690575,"modifiedTime":1752793135764,"sourceSize":3717,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Logs/Rhen Gorath Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-5.2-the-pasqual-solution.html":{"title":"Rhen Gorath Log 5.2 - The Pasqual Solution","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Hyperion Log 5.2 - The Pasqual Solution\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-5.2-the-pasqual-solution.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 5.2 - The Pasqual Solution</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Rhen Gorath\" href=\"crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rhen Gorath</a>\nStardate:: 62172Log:: With Admiral Stoker confined to quarters, we beamed the captain of the Vinshari vessel over to our Bridge, ensuring that no weapons were present on her way over. She identified herself as Casai, captain of the Maelstrom. She indicated it was vital that her people get the device and bring it back to its proper location. She kept mentioning The Assessor and The Tilikal, but was unable to explain to us the meaning of these words.At this point, Captain Kala went to speak to Admiral Stoker and get more information from her. While she is speaking to the Admiral, I attempted to persuade Captain Casai to show us where they encountered Admiral Stoker. Captain Kala returned and apologized to Captain Casai. At this point, she turned to me and informed me that she was leaving the Hyperion to go with Captain Casai and the Artifact to get more information on where they encountered Admiral Stoker, as well as The Assessor and The Tilikal, and she was leaving me in command. Despite my protests, she could not be convinced.With Captain Kala leaving on one of the shuttles, I am now in command of the Hyperion. I informed SILAR that while we will still need his expertise at the Science station, I will be leaning on him as my First Officer.We were able to persuade the Admiral to allow T'Lor to mind meld with her in an attempt to gain more information, and what we discovered was that her son, Avery Stoker, been taken away in handcuffs for blowing up part of Narendra Station. Admiral Stoker pleaded with us that he needs help and he's out there somewhere, stating that we have to believe her.While I do not discount this, I also do not believe we can take unilateral action here.

One thing that I have learned over my many lifetimes is that bonds are forged during the out of work social gatherings, and as such, we have been endeavoring to incorporate activities like this for the senior staff. Our holo-novel was interrupted by a distress call from our sister ship, the USS Nightingale. They reported suffering a navigational error that caused them to suddenly veer off course into the Neutral Zone and exchanged fire with a Romulan Warbird. Their captain was killed.We have been ordered to proceed at best possible speed and rescue the Nightingale and her crew, and we decided to spend our time preparing for as many potential Romulan threats and we can conceive of.Upon our arrival, we have discovered that the Nightingale was heavily damaged, but strangely, the Warbird is sitting there, with no shields active at all. We hailed the Nightingale to find that Captain Blake, prior to her demise, activated the Romulan Protocol, locking out the computer from the Romulans.We hailed the Romulans and encountered and old…friend…Subcommander Thal'vaek. SILAR and I convinced him to beam over to the Hyperion with an aide to hopefully allow for a peaceful resolution to the situation. Upon his arrival, the Subcommander expressed in odd interest in Dr. Verlath's being a Vorta, but we ultimately were able to persuade him to allow us to render aid to the survivors on the Nightingale, as long as his aide, T'Vel, accompanied our crew.Upon discussion with SILAR, we began to challenge the Subcommander and push back on him, hoping to appeal to his Romulan sensibilities more than simply protesting our innocence might do. However, mid-discussion, the Subcommander began to get more and more inquisitive about SILAR, specifically, his functioning as a holographic lifeform. He even attempted to get me to give the Commander to him as a gift of some kind, which obviously was not possible as he has his own free will.As such, SILAR then challenged him to a wrestling match, where if he won, the Subcommander would let us go free with the crew of the Nightingale, and if he lost, would allow Thal'Vaek to get information about SILAR and his construction. Unfortunately, SILAR did lose, but as the match ended, Lieutenant Commander Tara let us know that a shuttle left the Nightingale. We hurried to the bridge to find there was no response to hails, and Warbird began to charge her disruptors.Tara was able to extend our shields successfully around the shuttle, and when it continued to not respond to our hails, we tractored the shuttle into our shuttle bay. The shuttle was piloted by T'Lek, an officer from the Nightingale. We endeavored to get some information out of her, but her explanations made no sense at all. As Commander Tara began to take her to the brig, Subcommander Thal'Vaek pulled a disruptor and fired at her. Despite the valiant efforts of my crew, he killed her on the spot, leading us to conclude she was a Romulan spy. We beamed Subcommaner Thal'Vaek and his aide back to the Warbird and they allowed us to leave. We returned home to Starbase 364 with the Nightingale in tow and with a data rod full of sensor information from the shuttle that could be useful in the future.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[{"heading":"Captain's Log, Stardate 62216.7","level":4,"id":"Captain's_Log,_Stardate_62216.7_0"},{"heading":"Captain's Log, Supplemental","level":4,"id":"Captain's_Log,_Supplemental_0"},{"heading":"Captain's Log, Supplemental","level":4,"id":"Captain's_Log,_Supplemental_1"}],"links":["mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-6-border-dispute.html#_0","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-6-border-dispute.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1752793279469,"modifiedTime":1752793399261,"sourceSize":3624,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Logs/Rhen Gorath Log 6 - Border Dispute.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-6-border-dispute.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-0-all-aboard.html":{"title":"Hyperion Log 0 - All Aboard","icon":"","description":"\nThing Stardate:: 2030\nMission:: [[]]\nNote:: The crew of the USS Hyperion is assembled by captain Kala Cerjaso for a new mission to explore the Shackleton Expanse.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Bookkeeping","level":1,"id":"Bookkeeping_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-0-all-aboard.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1745834400196,"modifiedTime":1749045977835,"sourceSize":488,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 0 - All Aboard.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-0-all-aboard.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-1.1-bacchus'-irresistible-call.html":{"title":"Hyperion Log 1.1 - Bacchus' Irresistible Call","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 62023\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Bacchus' Irresistible Call\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/bacchus'-irresistible-call.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bacchus' Irresistible Call</a>\nNote:: The Hyperion was knocked out of warp by a subspace distortion while investigating a missing shuttle in the Bacchus system.

Back at Narendra Station, Admiral Stoker took custody of the artifact for further study.After the missing science team had been successfully treated, the crew of Hyperion decided to tackle escape from two fronts. First, an away team would return to the planet to investigate the facility, hoping to find an off switch. At the same time, a team on the Hyperion would attempt to outfit the starship to escape the Bacchus system by riding the Subspace wave out. The away team disabled the security system at the entrance to the monolith and navigated to the control room at the center. There a computer system informed them that the Facility was built to contained something or someone called The Displaced. Verlath was able to recognize genetic codes in the displays with telltale signs of modifications.In the end, the team disabled the subspace distortion wave, which triggered an emergency response from the facility. A breadbox sized artifact that the computer described as a \"key\" was revealed, which the away team took with them. The planet produced a massive tractor beam and pulled the planet Bacchus-2 out of orbit. It began using the rocky material of the planet to create new Monoliths.On the Hyperion, Buchanon and SILAR worked to integrate SILAR more deeply into the ship's control systems. The ship's sensors were connected directly to the nacelles to respond more quickly to changes in subspace. And SILAR's decision making processes were set as the control point for ship. SILAR was able to respond more quickly to changes in the gravitational profile of the system.

Soon after, the artifact was stolen, and the crew of the Hyperion recruited to help track it down. Collectively, they narrowed the options down to an Orion ship, the SS Castle Rock, that had left the station shortly after the theft.The Hyperion was sent in pursuit of the Castle Rock before it could get to the neutral zone, but was not fast enough. There, the Castle Rock was found disabled: the back section crushed in by some gravitational field coming from the artifact. The Orion captain Paljara refused to hand over the artifact and warned the Hyperion to flee. When they didn't, a Romulan Bird of Prey decloaked and announced their intention to \"protect\" the Orion vessel, who had been given passage rights.

In their wake, a disabled Orion freighter and potential casualties.SILAR, Verlath, Enat Tara, and Ensign Eric boarded the Orion freighter to recover the Bacchus Artifact. SILAR assumed an Orion disguise and eavesdropped on an argument between the Orion captain Paljara and some Romulan officers. She seemed distressed and was unable to explain to the officers why a crew member was interfaced with the artifact.Meanwhile, Verlath, Enat, and Eric moved to the other side of the ship to retrieve the artifact. The plan was to meet back in the middle and beam out without anyone knowing the wiser. They followed a Orion pirate to the cargo hold, where they saw 1 Orion interfaced with the Bacchus Artifact using a neural net.Unfortunately, Enat lost his temper with Verlath and his raised voice alerted some Orion pirates in the destroyed cargo hold. While Enat laid down supressing fire and held back the Romulans at the other end of the ship, Ensign Eric shot an explosive barrel in the cargo hold. This took out 3 Orions, one of whcih was the one interfaced with the artidfact. The artifact was thrown across the room by the explosion.During this fight, Captain Paljara hailed the Hyperion and begged Rhen Gorath to let them go with the artifiact. Paljara explained that her sister was beingheld by the Romulans and that the artifact was her ransom. Without it, her sister may be killed.Verlath ran across to grab it, but was beaten there by a pirate, who was then stunned. Verlath brought the artifact towards the Orion previously interfaced with it and set up pattern enhancers to beam out. The away team regrouped at the pattern engancer and beamed out.Meanwhile, Rhen Gorath had been engaging in debate and discussion with te Romulan sub-commander Thal'vaek. Commander Gorath was attempting to distract Thal'vaek until the away team could make it back to the Hyperion, and Thal'vaek was similarly trying to buy his officers time while they recovered the artifact. Thal'vaek challenged Gorath on their place in Starfleet, suggesting that all officers are just tools for government powers.When the away team returned with the artifact, Thal'vaek found out what had happened and ordered his ship to fire on the Hyperion. The Hyperion was able to warp out of the neutral zone quickly while taking damage to their shields.Back on Narendra Station, Admiral Banna Stoker congratulated the crew of the Hyperion and asked for the Artifact to be returned to the lab for her to inspect later. She dismissed concerns about the Orion casualties and declined to organize a rescue mission for Paljara's sister, potentially somewhere in Romulan space.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log - Supplemental:","level":10,"id":"First_Officer's_Log_-_Supplemental_0"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/the-orion-heist.html","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0","mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.2-the-orion-incident.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.2-orion-heist-part-2.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749007286553,"modifiedTime":1752715988093,"sourceSize":3191,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.2-orion-heist-part-2.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-4-peas-to-meet-you.html":{"title":"Hyperion Log 4 - Peas to Meet You","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 62139\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Peas to Meet You\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/peas-to-meet-you.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Peas to Meet You</a>\nNote:: The Hyperion assisted the USS Constantine in delivering a crucial agricultural exchange to a colony in the Yacci system.

A boarding party from the Hyperion found the crew of the Constantine acting strangely. The Executive officer seemed paranoid that someone was trying to assassinate the captain. The Captain was engaged in some sort of wrestling tournament, and various other crew members were exhibiting strong emotional reactions to things around them.When Buchanon went to engineering and found the chief engineer being consoled by a civilian from Re-Alpha, he were eating some ice peas, a fruit local to Re-Alpha. Scans found traces of tetraflouride-4, a neurotoxin which would cause different reactions from each person as a stress response. They tracked down the source of this neurotoxin to a plan on board called Ice Peas. The crop had been removed from it's natural habitat and was creating this neurotoxin in response to losing a particular fungus in it's soil.

The shuttle was damaged, and a physical slug was found embedded in the dented hull. Admiral Banna Stoker was the only one on board, carrying the Bacchus artifact with her.Once on board the Hyperion, Banna Stoker ordered the starship to head to the Pasqual system in the Shackleton Expanse. She warned she was attacked and may have been followed, so the Hyperion was not to respond to hails and travel at maximum warp. Suspicious of these orders, the crew of the Hyperion investigated. A medical examination showed the Admiral seemed to have no influence from the Artifact's subspace signals. Her shuttles logs showed that Stoker had visited several systems in the Shackleton Expanse before arriving at the Hyperion.The Hyperion found the planet Pasqual-1, inhabited by a late-medieval society and covered in hundreds of black neutronium monoliths. Stoker wanted an away team to investigate, but Rhen Gorath and the rest of the crew refused. Stoker was furious, and threatened to have Rhen Gorath reprimanded for disobeying orders.Before the Hyperion could leave the system, a unidentified starship dropped out of warp and demanded Stoker hand over the artifact. They claimed that Stoker was in possession of their property. The unidentified ship attacked, and both ships have now sustained damage to their shields.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log, Stardate 62158.5","level":10,"id":"First_Officer's_Log,_Stardate_62158.5_0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log, Supplemental","level":10,"id":"First_Officer's_Log,_Supplemental_0"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/simplicity.html","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0","mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1751471716415,"modifiedTime":1752715995876,"sourceSize":2248,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-5.2-the-pasqual-solution.html":{"title":"Hyperion Log 5.2 - The Pasqual Solution","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 62172\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Simplicity\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/simplicity.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Simplicity</a>\nNote:: The Hyperion disabled the Vinshari cruiser and opened negotiations over the Bacchus artifact.

But the Hyperion created a sensor shadow to fake the image of another starship in the system. This caused the Vinshari ship to retreat behind the planet and swing around and attack from the other side.The Hyperion disabled the Vinshari starship, effectively opening it up to negotiations again. Admiral Stoker was confined to quarters after attempting to destroy the defenceless Vinshari vessel.

On board the Nightingale, a Romulan spy disguised as a Vulcan worked to gain access to Federation intel, but was ultimately killed by Thal'vaek himself after being arrested on board the Hyperion.The USS Hyperion was summoned to rescue the USS Nightingale, a Federation science vessel which had drifted unexpectedly into the neutral zone. There, a Romulan Warbird commanded by sub-commander Thal'vaek claimed the crew members as prisoners of war.After a short negotiation, Thalvaek allowed an away team on board the Nightingale to help the injured and life support systems. The Nightingale's executive officer, Cmdr. Allison Lewis, was now in command. Captain Blake had died in the attack. Lewis explained that most of the ships functions had been completely disabled by the Romulan Protocol, an emergency system to prevent enemies from gaining access to Federation intel or commandeering a Federation ship.Verlath started by heading to the ship's sick-bay, and found dead and wounded taking up space even in the corridors outside. Verlath helped the nurses do triage and treated some of the worst patients. Among the dead, Verlath found Captain Blake, who had suffered a head injury apparently moments after activating the Romulan protocol.Lt. Buchanon made his way to the Nightingale's engineering room to evaluate the damage and attempt to restore power to the rest of the ship. There, he found most of the engineering team dead, and an electro-plasma conduit aflame. He extinguished the electro-plasma fire by shutting off avalve to the conduit, and then gain access to the engineering console. Although the ship's computers had completely shut off access from the the Romulan protocol, Buchanon could hot wire the engineering consoles to gain basic local functions.\nOn board the Hyperion, Thal'vaek routinely commented on the novelty of SILAR's nature, and was morbidly curious about it. So SILAR challenged Thal'vaek to a wrestling match. The terms: If SILAR wins, then Thal'vaek would leave the Nightingale alone and return to Romulan space. If Thal'vaek won, then SILAR would submit himself for study under the Romulans.As negotiations with Thal'vaek continued, a Federation shuttle departed from the Nightingale on course to join the Warbird. The Hyperion extended it's shields around the shuttle and caught it in its tractor beam. T'Lek was on board the shuttle and quickly arrested for attempting to abscond intel to the Romulans.However, as T'Lek was arrested, Thal'vaek quickly pulled a phaser off of Rhen Gorath's belt and killed T'Lek with it. Thal'vaek told Captain Gorath that he has taken care of a Romulan spy in their midst, and asked to be returned to his ship. Under threat of being fired upon by the Warbird, and potentially starting a war, Thalvaek was returned to his ship, and the Hyperion departed.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"},{"heading":"Captain's Log, Stardate 62216.7","level":10,"id":"Captain's_Log,_Stardate_62216.7_0"},{"heading":"Captain's Log, Supplemental","level":10,"id":"Captain's_Log,_Supplemental_0"},{"heading":"Captain's Log, Supplemental","level":10,"id":"Captain's_Log,_Supplemental_1"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/border-dispute.html","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0","mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-6-border-dispute.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-6-border-dispute.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1752715935071,"modifiedTime":1752745710813,"sourceSize":3419,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 6 - Border Dispute.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-6-border-dispute.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-7-holo-spies.html":{"title":"Hyperion Log 7 - Holo Spies","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 62236\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Life and Soul (Holodeck)\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/missions/bottle-episodes/life-and-soul-(holodeck).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Life and Soul (Holodeck)</a>\nNote:: The crew investigated a strange holodeck program found on Admiral Stoker’s shuttle. On it, they found a 1950’s super spy scenario in which Stoker had hidden detailed logs of her solo adventures in the Shackleton Expanse. They found them disguised as the blueprints for atomic weapons in the private mansion of German weapons dealer.As Star Fleet prepared for Admiral Stoker’s trial, Chief Engineer Nak was picking apart her shuttle, looking for hidden evidence. He found a holodeck program, created on the shuttle itself during her solo excursion into the Shackleton Expanse. Nak agreed to give it to the bridge crew of the Hyperion, on condition that he be allowed to come see what's in the program with them.The program was a pulpy 1950's themed spy mission, where the party was tasked with recovering atomic bomb blueprints from a german weapons dealer named Mr Halgrave.Halgrave was hosting a birthday party, where multiple other people were trying to acquire the plans. Most of the other guests were invited by Halgrave for his supposed birthday party. But Allied intelligence suspected the party was cover for an auction.At the party, Halgrave was no where to be seen. But the crew met with several would-be buyers at the auction. Slowly, they pieced together that Mr. Halgrave had no intention of selling the atomic weapons. Instead, Halgrave intended to murder everyone at the party, including his own delinquent son.Verlath remembered just in the nick of time to pause the program and request the computer remove all the weapons from Mr. Halgrave and his goons. With their weapons missing, Halgrave quickly surrendered to the crew and showed the atomic weapons blueprints to them.But the blueprints were not blueprints at all. Instead, there was a large conspiracy board full of logs, maps, and other data pertaining to Stoker’s solo adventure into the Shackleton Expanse, including a star map of suspected “Facility” locations and first-contact conversations with people calling themselves Akaru and Vinshari. In these conversation, Stoker attempted to threaten these new civilizations with the power of the Federation unless they revealed any ancient alien artifacts or facilities on their planets.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":["shackleton-expanse/missions/bottle-episodes/life-and-soul-(holodeck).html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-7-holo-spies.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1752716022283,"modifiedTime":1752758004653,"sourceSize":2653,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 7 - Holo Spies.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-7-holo-spies.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"other-characters/banna-stoker.html":{"title":"Banna Stoker","icon":"","description":"Admiral Banna StokerInfo\nPronouns:: She/Her\nLocation:: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Narendra Station Season 1\" data-href=\"Narendra Station Season 1\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/locations/shackleton-expanse/narendra-station-season-1.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Narendra Station</a>\nType:: Major NPC\nStatus:: Commissioned\nNumRank:: -4\nRank:: Admiral\nSpecies:: Human\nRole:: Sector Commander<br>\nPortrait:: <img alt=\"IMG-20250226-Banna Stoker - Background}.png\" src=\"attachments/shackleton-expanse/characters/season-1/admiral-banna-stoker/img-20250226-banna-stoker-background}.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 300px; max-width: 100%;\">\nNote:: Commanding Narendra Station and looking for life among the stars.\n<br>Admiral Banna Stoker is a short, stocky Human with close-cropped white hair.

When the Hyperion arrive, it was violently thrown out of warp by a massive subspace distortion wave. With warp-speed rendered impossible and subspace communications completely washed out by background subspace frequencies in the system, an away was sent down to Bacchus-3 to investigate the source of the distortion waves. There, a small coalition team of Starfleet and Klingon officers seemed entranced by the giant monoliths sticking out of the surface of the planet.

The away team discovered the site was built to contain something called The Displaced and recovered a mysterious artifact labeled a “key.” As the planet began forming new Monoliths, SILAR guided the Hyperion safely out of the system. Back at Narendra Station, Admiral Stoker took custody of the artifact for further study.After the missing science team had been successfully treated, the crew of Hyperion decided to tackle escape from two fronts. First, an away team would return to the planet to investigate the facility, hoping to find an off switch. At the same time, a team on the Hyperion would attempt to outfit the starship to escape the Bacchus system by riding the Subspace wave out. The away team disabled the security system at the entrance to the monolith and navigated to the control room at the center. There a computer system informed them that the Facility was built to contained something or someone called The Displaced. Verlath was able to recognize genetic codes in the displays with telltale signs of modifications.In the end, the team disabled the subspace distortion wave, which triggered an emergency response from the facility. A breadbox sized artifact that the computer described as a \"key\" was revealed, which the away team took with them. The planet produced a massive tractor beam and pulled the planet Bacchus-2 out of orbit. It began using the rocky material of the planet to create new Monoliths.On the Hyperion, Buchanon and SILAR worked to integrate SILAR more deeply into the ship's control systems. The ship's sensors were connected directly to the nacelles to respond more quickly to changes in subspace. And SILAR's decision making processes were set as the control point for ship. SILAR was able to respond more quickly to changes in the gravitational profile of the system. Rhen Gorath piloted the waverider to meet with the Hyperion, and they all warped out of the system, back to Narendra Station.Admiral Banna Stoker debriefed the team on Narendra Station, and took the artifact for study, assigning science officer Kassandra Pruitt to investigate.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 2 - Imminent Collision.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 2 - Imminent Collision.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-2-imminent-collision.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 2 - Imminent Collision</a>: Stardate 62078.6, Session: 4The Hyperion made first contact with a new species made of crystal that communicated with refracted light.

Gorath and SILAR spent much of their time working on deciphering the light-based language they communicated with, making some progress on terms used during the mission. Buchanan made a deal with Nax to take a crate of stem bolts off the station.Verlath was brought into the sick bay to help stabilize Kassandra Pruitt, whose neurological functions were suddenly declining after a research project with the Bacchus Artifact. Soon after, the artifact was stolen, and the crew of the Hyperion recruited to help track it down. Collectively, they narrowed the options down to an Orion ship, the SS Castle Rock, that had left the station shortly after the theft.The Hyperion was sent in pursuit of the Castle Rock before it could get to the neutral zone, but was not fast enough. There, the Castle Rock was found disabled: the back section crushed in by some gravitational field coming from the artifact. The Orion captain Paljara refused to hand over the artifact and warned the Hyperion to flee. When they didn't, a Romulan Bird of Prey decloaked and announced their intention to \"protect\" the Orion vessel, who had been given passage rights. They also sent engineers aboard the Orion freighter to provide assistance with repairs.Verlath was able to disguise the life signs of Enat Tara and himself. They beamed aboard the Orion vessel along with SILAR to recover the artifact as quickly as possible. Two Orions were beamed from the Castle Rock into the Hyperion's brig to keep the number of life signs consistent.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.2-orion-heist-part-2.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2</a>: Stardate 62098, Session: 6An away team from the Hyperion stormed the Orion freighter and recovered the Bacchus Artifact. In their wake, a disabled Orion freighter and potential casualties.SILAR, Verlath, Enat Tara, and Ensign Eric boarded the Orion freighter to recover the Bacchus Artifact. SILAR assumed an Orion disguise and eavesdropped on an argument between the Orion captain Paljara and some Romulan officers. She seemed distressed and was unable to explain to the officers why a crew member was interfaced with the artifact.Meanwhile, Verlath, Enat, and Eric moved to the other side of the ship to retrieve the artifact. The plan was to meet back in the middle and beam out without anyone knowing the wiser. They followed a Orion pirate to the cargo hold, where they saw 1 Orion interfaced with the Bacchus Artifact using a neural net.Unfortunately, Enat lost his temper with Verlath and his raised voice alerted some Orion pirates in the destroyed cargo hold. While Enat laid down supressing fire and held back the Romulans at the other end of the ship, Ensign Eric shot an explosive barrel in the cargo hold. This took out 3 Orions, one of whcih was the one interfaced with the artidfact. The artifact was thrown across the room by the explosion.During this fight, Captain Paljara hailed the Hyperion and begged Rhen Gorath to let them go with the artifiact. Paljara explained that her sister was beingheld by the Romulans and that the artifact was her ransom. Without it, her sister may be killed.Verlath ran across to grab it, but was beaten there by a pirate, who was then stunned. Verlath brought the artifact towards the Orion previously interfaced with it and set up pattern enhancers to beam out. The away team regrouped at the pattern engancer and beamed out.Meanwhile, Rhen Gorath had been engaging in debate and discussion with te Romulan sub-commander Thal'vaek. Commander Gorath was attempting to distract Thal'vaek until the away team could make it back to the Hyperion, and Thal'vaek was similarly trying to buy his officers time while they recovered the artifact. Thal'vaek challenged Gorath on their place in Starfleet, suggesting that all officers are just tools for government powers.When the away team returned with the artifact, Thal'vaek found out what had happened and ordered his ship to fire on the Hyperion. The Hyperion was able to warp out of the neutral zone quickly while taking damage to their shields.Back on Narendra Station, Admiral Banna Stoker congratulated the crew of the Hyperion and asked for the Artifact to be returned to the lab for her to inspect later. She dismissed concerns about the Orion casualties and declined to organize a rescue mission for Paljara's sister, potentially somewhere in Romulan space.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 4 - Peas to Meet You.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 4 - Peas to Meet You.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-4-peas-to-meet-you.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 4 - Peas to Meet You</a>: Stardate 62139, Session: 7The Hyperion assisted the USS Constantine in delivering a crucial agricultural exchange to a colony in the Yacci system. The crew and passengers of the Constantine had succumbed to a neurotoxin produced by Ice Peas while not in it's natural habitat.The USS Hyperion was sent to investigate the USS Constantine, a Galaxy Class starship itself tasked with transporting an agricultural exchange from the Colony on Re-Alpha to a struggling colony on Yacci. A boarding party from the Hyperion found the crew of the Constantine acting strangely. The Executive officer seemed paranoid that someone was trying to assassinate the captain. The Captain was engaged in some sort of wrestling tournament, and various other crew members were exhibiting strong emotional reactions to things around them.When Buchanon went to engineering and found the chief engineer being consoled by a civilian from Re-Alpha, he were eating some ice peas, a fruit local to Re-Alpha. Scans found traces of tetraflouride-4, a neurotoxin which would cause different reactions from each person as a stress response. They tracked down the source of this neurotoxin to a plan on board called Ice Peas. The crop had been removed from it's natural habitat and was creating this neurotoxin in response to losing a particular fungus in it's soil. SILAR and Verlath were able to create a virus that were rewrite the genome of the Ice Pea bush to block its ability to produce tetraflouride-4. With the neurotoxin neutralized, the colony would be able to continue to Yacci and complete it's mission.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem</a>: Stardate 62172, Session: 8Admiral Banna Stoker joined the hyperion after being attacked in the Shackleton Expanse, and ordered them to head to the Pasqual system. There, Rhen Gorath refused her orders to send an away team to the planet based on Prime Directive concerns. They were then attacked by an unidentified starship that claimed the Bacchus artifact was their property.The Hyperion was performing a routine survey sweep around Narendra station when a federation runabout shuttle was encountered coming out of the Shackleton Expanse. The shuttle was damaged, and a physical slug was found embedded in the dented hull. Admiral Banna Stoker was the only one on board, carrying the Bacchus artifact with her.Once on board the Hyperion, Banna Stoker ordered the starship to head to the Pasqual system in the Shackleton Expanse. She warned she was attacked and may have been followed, so the Hyperion was not to respond to hails and travel at maximum warp. Suspicious of these orders, the crew of the Hyperion investigated. A medical examination showed the Admiral seemed to have no influence from the Artifact's subspace signals. Her shuttles logs showed that Stoker had visited several systems in the Shackleton Expanse before arriving at the Hyperion.The Hyperion found the planet Pasqual-1, inhabited by a late-medieval society and covered in hundreds of black neutronium monoliths. Stoker wanted an away team to investigate, but Rhen Gorath and the rest of the crew refused. Stoker was furious, and threatened to have Rhen Gorath reprimanded for disobeying orders.Before the Hyperion could leave the system, a unidentified starship dropped out of warp and demanded Stoker hand over the artifact. They claimed that Stoker was in possession of their property. The unidentified ship attacked, and both ships have now sustained damage to their shields.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 5.2 - The Pasqual Solution.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 5.2 - The Pasqual Solution.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-5.2-the-pasqual-solution.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 5.2 - The Pasqual Solution</a>: Stardate 62172, Session: 9The Hyperion disabled the Vinshari cruiser and opened negotiations over the Bacchus artifact. Unable to come to an agreement, Kala Cerjaso decided to join the Vinshari with the artifact to negotiation with their leadership on their homeworld. Admiral Stoker was arrested and confined to quarters for attempting to destroy the Vinshari vessel.At Pasqual-1, the Hyperion continued to engage with the Vinshari battlecruiser, which hooked onto the Hyperion with a physical harpoon. But the Hyperion created a sensor shadow to fake the image of another starship in the system. This caused the Vinshari ship to retreat behind the planet and swing around and attack from the other side.The Hyperion disabled the Vinshari starship, effectively opening it up to negotiations again. Admiral Stoker was confined to quarters after attempting to destroy the defenceless Vinshari vessel. The captain, introducing herself as \"something\", restated that the Admiral had trespassed into Vinshari space and was in possession of Vinshari property, alluding to the Bacchus artifact Stoker carried with her. The Vinshari's claim to the Bacchus artifact was ancestral. Captain Kala Cerjaso distrusted the Vinshari, but equally distrusted the Admiral. She offered to follow the Vinshari back to their homeworld to conduct more formal negotiations with the Vinshari leadership.The Vinshari did not wish to reveal the location of their homeworld to the Federation, so instead, Captain Cerjaso agreed to join the Vinshari vessel an return with them into the Shackleton Expanse. Commander Rhen Gorath would be acting captain until her return.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 6 - Border Dispute.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 6 - Border Dispute.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-6-border-dispute.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 6 - Border Dispute</a>: Stardate 62217, Session: 10The Hyperion rescued the USS Nightingale from being taken by Romulan Sub-Commander Thal'vaek as prisoners of war after they inadvertently entered the Neutral Zone. On board the Nightingale, a Romulan spy disguised as a Vulcan worked to gain access to Federation intel, but was ultimately killed by Thal'vaek himself after being arrested on board the Hyperion.The USS Hyperion was summoned to rescue the USS Nightingale, a Federation science vessel which had drifted unexpectedly into the neutral zone. There, a Romulan Warbird commanded by sub-commander Thal'vaek claimed the crew members as prisoners of war.After a short negotiation, Thalvaek allowed an away team on board the Nightingale to help the injured and life support systems. The Nightingale's executive officer, Cmdr. Allison Lewis, was now in command. Captain Blake had died in the attack. Lewis explained that most of the ships functions had been completely disabled by the Romulan Protocol, an emergency system to prevent enemies from gaining access to Federation intel or commandeering a Federation ship.Verlath started by heading to the ship's sick-bay, and found dead and wounded taking up space even in the corridors outside. Verlath helped the nurses do triage and treated some of the worst patients. Among the dead, Verlath found Captain Blake, who had suffered a head injury apparently moments after activating the Romulan protocol.Lt. Buchanon made his way to the Nightingale's engineering room to evaluate the damage and attempt to restore power to the rest of the ship. There, he found most of the engineering team dead, and an electro-plasma conduit aflame. He extinguished the electro-plasma fire by shutting off avalve to the conduit, and then gain access to the engineering console. Although the ship's computers had completely shut off access from the the Romulan protocol, Buchanon could hot wire the engineering consoles to gain basic local functions.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 7 - Holo Spies.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 7 - Holo Spies.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-7-holo-spies.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 7 - Holo Spies</a>: Stardate 62236, Session: 11The crew investigated a strange holodeck program found on Admiral Stoker’s shuttle. On it, they found a 1950’s super spy scenario in which Stoker had hidden detailed logs of her solo adventures in the Shackleton Expanse. They found them disguised as the blueprints for atomic weapons in the private mansion of German weapons dealer.As Star Fleet prepared for Admiral Stoker’s trial, Chief Engineer Nak was picking apart her shuttle, looking for hidden evidence. He found a holodeck program, created on the shuttle itself during her solo excursion into the Shackleton Expanse. Nak agreed to give it to the bridge crew of the Hyperion, on condition that he be allowed to come see what's in the program with them.The program was a pulpy 1950's themed spy mission, where the party was tasked with recovering atomic bomb blueprints from a german weapons dealer named Mr Halgrave.Halgrave was hosting a birthday party, where multiple other people were trying to acquire the plans. Most of the other guests were invited by Halgrave for his supposed birthday party. But Allied intelligence suspected the party was cover for an auction.At the party, Halgrave was no where to be seen. But the crew met with several would-be buyers at the auction. Slowly, they pieced together that Mr. Halgrave had no intention of selling the atomic weapons. Instead, Halgrave intended to murder everyone at the party, including his own delinquent son.Verlath remembered just in the nick of time to pause the program and request the computer remove all the weapons from Mr. Halgrave and his goons. With their weapons missing, Halgrave quickly surrendered to the crew and showed the atomic weapons blueprints to them.But the blueprints were not blueprints at all. Instead, there was a large conspiracy board full of logs, maps, and other data pertaining to Stoker’s solo adventure into the Shackleton Expanse, including a star map of suspected “Facility” locations and first-contact conversations with people calling themselves Akaru and Vinshari. In these conversation, Stoker attempted to threaten these new civilizations with the power of the Federation unless they revealed any ancient alien artifacts or facilities on their planets.
