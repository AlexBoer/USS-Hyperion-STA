ZOOM.\n<br>Jarek Vossin grew up on <a data-href=\"Terpen-4\" href=\"crew/terpen-4.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Terpen-4</a>, an isolated mining colony located on the fringe of Federation space. Terpin-4, an M Class planet, is surrounded by asteroids thought to be the remains of a moon that shattered due to tidal forces.The composition of these asteroids makes them randomly resonate with Terpen IV’s magnetic field which generates a lot of interference. This causes issues with transporters (especially surface-to-orbit) leaving them unreliable, thus leading to most shipments on and off the planet being performed by complex shuttle routes, further isolating the colony from resources.Due to these circumstances, Jarek grew up having to repair and jury-rig things on the fly using the materials at hand. He showed an aptitude for mechanics and engineering and was involved with the mining operations, working closely with his father who was a mechanic. The asteroid situation has also generated a culture where piloting skills are highly regarded.The more daring youth of the colony have even made competitions of shuttle racing through the asteroids. Jarek spent time on these flying runs and has become a capable pilot. Showing promise in many disciplines, Jarek was encouraged to attend Starfleet Academy by his uncle who was enlisted, and after graduation he has served on several Federation starships as a junior officer before gaining his first senior assignment on the USS Hyperion as Operation Manager.Table2 resultsSort2Filter1PropertiesNewList of MissionsMission14 Pasqual's Progress","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Characters/PC","#Division/Ops","#DepartmentHead"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Missions","level":1,"id":"Missions_0"}],"links":["crew/terpen-4.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"crew/jarek-vossin.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/hyperion/shared/crew/jarek-vossin/img-20251125-jarek-bg}.webp"],"createdTime":1764062771946,"modifiedTime":1764664921546,"sourceSize":2714,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Crew/Jarek Vossin.md","exportPath":"crew/jarek-vossin.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":4,"backlinks":["mission-logs/season-2/hyperion-log-14.2-assimilation.html","mission-logs/season-2/hyperion-log-14.1-the-face-of-borg.html"],"type":"markdown"},"crew/jonathan-belaris.html":{"title":"Jonathan Belaris","icon":"","description":"Info\nPronouns: he/him\nRank: Lt Commander\nSpecies: Denobulan, Vulcan\nRole: Chief Medical Officer\nPortrait:: <img alt=\"IMG-20251125-Jonanthan bg}.png\" src=\"attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/hyperion/shared/crew/jonathan-belaris/img-20251125-jonanthan-bg}.png\" target=\"_self\">\nNote: Raised in London on Earth, but instilled with Denobulan and Vulcan values.\nTable0 resultsSortFilterPropertiesNew","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#Characters/PC","#Division/Sciences","#DepartmentHead"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Missions","level":1,"id":"Missions_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"crew/jonathan-belaris.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/hyperion/shared/crew/jonathan-belaris/img-20251125-jonanthan-bg}.png"],"createdTime":1764081147713,"modifiedTime":1764086812833,"sourceSize":1318,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Crew/Jonathan Belaris.md","exportPath":"crew/jonathan-belaris.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":5,"backlinks":["mission-logs/season-2/hyperion-log-14.2-assimilation.html","mission-logs/season-2/hyperion-log-14.1-the-face-of-borg.html"],"type":"markdown"},"crew/kalaa-cerjaso.html":{"title":"Kalaa Cerjaso","icon":"","description":"Info\nPronouns: she/her\nRank: Captain\nSpecies: Bajoran\nRole: Commanding Officer\nPortrait:: <img alt=\"IMG-20251008-Cerjaso bg}-1.png\" src=\"attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/hyperion/shared/crew/kalaa-cerjaso/img-20251008-cerjaso-bg}-1.png\" target=\"_self\">\nNote: On her first assignment as captain and in over her head.\n<br><img alt=\"IMG-20251008-download20241201132238}.png\" src=\"attachments/shackleton-expanse/groups/hyperion/shared/crew/kalaa-cerjaso/img-20251008-download20241201132238}.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 200px;

From a reddit post <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/hsl9nh/a_setting_overview_for_2380/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/hsl9nh/a_setting_overview_for_2380/\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.\nThe adventure starts in the year 2385, 6 years after the USS Voyager returned to Earth, and 3 years after the conclusion of the Dominion War. The Alpha and Beta Quadrants are in an uneasy but stable peace.The Romulans are more wary and less arrogant in regard to the Federation. They have somehow become aware of actions Section 31 took to end the Dominion War, and contrary to the horror Federation leadership had when they learned of it, the Romulans seem to have taken it as a sign that they have gravely underestimated the Federation.From their perspective, the Federation encountered a civilization that attempted to subvert them and subjugate them in the Dominion, and instead of taking the expected actions by conceding everything one piece at a time until it was all lost, the Federation prompted direct confrontation by mining the wormhole and actively attacking their opponent’s logistical support.Once the war had begun, the Federation was able to somehow not only convince the Klingons to fight at their side, but to do so at the direction of Starfleet, which the Romulan government found to be a totally incredulous idea. A Starfleet captain had orchestrated the assassination of a Romulan Senator in order to manipulate them into fighting at the Federation’s side as well! Finally, the Federation showed a willingness to engage in total war when existentially threatened.Limited trade, and the continuation of the Neutral Zone as well as the Treaty of Algeron, will maintain the status quo while the Romulans put in effort to modernize and update their fleet and empire.The Klingons have become much closer to the Federation since the victory over the Cardassians and the Dominion. Many within the Houses have suggested that the consistency of honor in battle by Starfleet is a sign of a worthy ally, and that the empire should seek to continue the friendly relationship it now has with Starfleet and the Federation.This is at odds with the renewed thirst for battle that Klingon society is experiencing, however it is obvious now that the Federation would make terrible enemies if direct conflict happened, and it is unlikely that the Federation would stand by should the Klingon Empire seek to expand once again, even if it wasn’t near the Federation.Klingon society also depends heavily at this point on dilithium imports from the Federation, and their society has become far too economically tied to the Federation for open conflict to be anything except painful.Some Klingons suggest that in primarily exploring, the average Starfleet vessel encounters more battle than the average Klingon vessel does. Because of this, there is a growing sentiment that a Klingon who joins Starfleet has a better chance of finding glory than a Klingon who serves the empire. Some have even suggested that the empire should join the Federation and find glory in defending it against the many foes it has, some of which are quite formidable such as the Borg.This sentiment is not yet widespread, and though it is talked about by many Klingons, it is always in hushed voices. There have been many more Klingons who have joined Starfleet however, and while some were unable to make it in an environment where they needed to respect and follow the orders of non-Klingon superiors, others have found their lives to be much better and more fulfilling.There is also the risk of the thirst for battle being turned inward. Without a good path to conquer other societies, and with the conflict in opinion about the Federation, the stability of the Klingon Empire is threatened, and it is possible that a civil war may break out over cooperation with the Federation. This would be just as much due to their thirst for battle having no viable outlet as it would be to the disagreement itself.Utterly ruined by the war, Cardassian society totally collapsed due to the conflict. During the post-war occupation by the Federation, Klingons, and Romulans, Cardassian society was transformed. The common Cardassian was opened to the idea that while their loyalty had always been to the state, the state’s loyalty hadn’t always been to them.The catastrophic loss of life left the people open to new ideas, and during the four years of occupation and rebuilding (which ended officially in 2379), Bajoran society was perhaps ironically a huge influence on Cardassia.Cardassians now have a nascent society which values the art and culture of their people. They are all aware of just how close their society and culture came to extermination at the hands of either the Dominion or the Alliance forces, and there is an existential need among Cardassians to show that their culture is one worth preserving. That it is better for everyone that they didn’t die to the last man.The Detapa Council has been remade, but in a move that would have been unthinkable only a decade ago, most of its members are now elected by the people. In addition to the elected members, the council has two members that are elected by members of the military, one member who is elected by members of the remade Obsidian order, and one more member who is elected by Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory. This, combined with the five members elected by the Cardassian public, make up the nine people who make up the council.A large number of Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory live on Bajor, which is to some ironic. However, it is obvious to even the most proud Cardassian how much of their survival is due to the efforts of a Bajoran freedom fighter, Kira Nerys.One of the first actions taken by the reformed Detapa Council was to make a formal apology to the people of Bajor, and a promise of reparations once Cardassian society was capable. This might have been received quite coldly, except for the words of Kira. She argued to the Council of Ministers that the Cardassian people, and Cardassian society, had received their punishment already.Her testimony of the ways in which Cardassians had suffered, and the extent of the suffering, swayed not only the Ministers, but much of Bajoran society. Many began to view the Cardassian people not as evil, but as being victims of their out-of-control military almost as much as the Bajorans had been, an analogy that Kira herself made.Because of this, the apology was accepted, but the offer of reparations was officially rejected by the Bajoran government. Their response was that any help such reparations might have provided to Bajor had already been taken care of by the Federation, and that instead the Bajorans would help the Federation in doing the same for Cardassian culture.Such help from a people that many Cardassians were aware of having suffered so brutally at their hands, a people that were not Cardassian, was one of the turning points in the rebuilding of Cardassian society.Today, Cardassia and Bajor are each the second largest populations of their respective species outside of their homeworlds, and there is extensive trade between the two. Many Cardassians have become fascinated by the Bajoran religion of the Prophets, and many Bajorans have become fascinated by the talent for art that many Cardassians have, especially when most Bajorans grew up believing that the only talent Cardassians had was brutality.Near the end of the occupation period, when Bajor was admitted to the Federation, some Cardassians began to suggest that Cardassia should also ask to join the Federation. The argument was that the Federation was already there rebuilding their society, and perhaps the way forward was the Federation to simply not leave.While this idea was considered more warily by some Cardassians, very few were vehemently opposed to it. Even so, Cardassian leadership, Bajoran advisors, and the Federation itself all argued against it.Cardassian leadership argued that the Cardassian people hadn’t ever really had the chance to figure out who they were as a people, and they needed to do this before such a thing could be considered.Bajoran leadership argued that the Cardassian people were in the same situation the Bajorans had been, and that it was important that they saw themselves stand on their own feet before making such a decision. They said that they understood and sympathized with the idea, because many on Bajor had felt the same way when the Cardassians had left and the Federation had stepped in. But they said that now they see how valuable it had been to stand on their own for a while first.The Federation argued that while they would be happy to provide whatever humanitarian assistance was necessary, there were simply too many fresh wounds that needed time to heal. The Federation Council privately told the Cardassian leadership that it was unlikely the Cardassian people would be given a fair consideration be some of its members if the request was made so soon, and that further, some members of the Federation would feel it was too much like conquering and annexing Cardassia.Cardassian society now finds itself in a stable if somewhat raw state, ready to venture out with new perspective for the first time since becoming warp capable.The final efforts of the Voyager crew with regard to the Borg are highly classified. What is commonly understood among the rank-and-file is that the Borg were dealt a severe blow, and that the Federation considers any incursion by the Borg for the foreseeable future to be unlikely.Even so, Starfleet crews and ships are still designed and trained with conflict with the Borg in mind, and though the details are known to only a select few, it is apparent to many within Starfleet that the technologies to deal with the Borg are still in active development.The status of Seven of Nine, and her existence is now widely known throughout all of the Federation, and consequently throughout the quadrant. However, whether because she has been instructed not to or because she does not wish to, she has never publicly commented on the Borg or her experiences with them.Only two further contacts with the Dominion have been made since the end of the war and the return of Odo to The Great Link. The first contact came in 2375 only weeks after the war had ended and was a more formal accounting of the parameters of surrender the Federation was imposing on the Dominion. These included prohibiting any Dominion forces from entering the Alpha Quadrant by any means, and the requirement for any Changelings who enter the Alpha Quadrant to stop at Deep Space Nine to notify the Federation of their intended destination and purpose.As an enforcement measure, the Federation imposed a mandatory search for Changelings of any vessel returning through the wormhole for at least the next 10 years. This extraordinary measure would not normally have been palatable to the Federation, but the war had been so vast and so destructive that not only Federation citizens, but even the Klingons and Romulans saw the wisdom of allowing the Federation to search all vessels returning from the Gamma Quadrant.Since neither the Romulans nor the Klingons trusted each other to not use their cloaking technology to try and evade these searches, Deep Space Nine was provided with advanced cloak scanning technology by them. This technology was provided in a closed system that was not open for study to Federation engineers, and Klingon or Romulan personnel have had to visit to maintain it any time it has suffered a malfunction.According to the agreement signed by the three governments, the technology is only ever used if the wormhole opens with no apparent ship transit. Further, all three governments are provided the results of all searches, including those done using the cloak scanning technology.The Federation did decide however to allow commerce and civilian traffic through the wormhole, no matter who it came from, deciding to operate Deep Space Nine as something like a freeport. Normal Federation import laws would not apply to Deep Space Nine unless the cargo was purely military in nature, or the destination for the cargo was within the Federation.The Dominion was surprised by this concession by the Federation, considering that they had surrendered unconditionally to save the Changelings from extinction. Over the last five years, commerce has slowly but surely increased, and this combined with the newfound understanding the Link obtained from Odo, has convinced the Dominion that it may actually be possible to maintain relations with some solids as equals at some point in the future.The second contact between the Federation and the Dominion came in 2377. It involved setting up a subspace link through the wormhole to enable open communication between the two powers in the future, and the construction effort for this relay was still underway, being hesitantly constructed from both sides.For the time being, the Dominion has remained within their borders and mostly silent.Little contact had been made with the Breen prior to the war, but the attack on Earth ensured that they were a prominent species in the mind of the Federation after the war ended. Their remaining ships retreated back to Breen space, ignoring all demands and efforts at contact from the Federation. Though many suggested that the Breen could simply be allowed to “go home without consequences”, no one was willing to immediately mount a campaign of aggression into Breen space.The Breen have remained conspicuously silent since the end of the war, even cutting off trade with the Ferengi, and seemingly every other species that the Federation has contact with. Starfleet Command remains very concerned about the reasons for this and about possible future conflict with the Breen, and their technology is being actively studied by Starfleet to prepare for the possibility of a conflict in the future.For the moment however, they seem to have retreated into isolation.In some ways Ferengi culture has changed radically. The impact of Rom becoming the Grand Nagus cannot be overstated, and Ferengi society has become far more equal among men and women. There has also been an emphasis from Rom on “long-term profits”, and how duplicitous business results in fewer business opportunities in the future.In other ways though, the Ferengi remain the Ferengi. While Ferengi privateers and plots remain a consistent problem for the Federation, their frequency has declined, and their scope is generally smaller. The Federation is not aware of any efforts to steal a Starfleet ship since the end of the war, although several thefts of Federation designed civilian ships have occurred.In general, the Ferengi seem to be holding up their end of agreements more frequently, and they have been the largest benefactors of the Federation policies regarding Deep Space Nine and the Gamma Quadrant following the war.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Timeline","level":2,"id":"Timeline_0"},{"heading":"The Romulans","level":2,"id":"The_Romulans_0"},{"heading":"The Klingons","level":2,"id":"The_Klingons_0"},{"heading":"The Cardassians","level":2,"id":"The_Cardassians_0"},{"heading":"The Borg","level":2,"id":"The_Borg_0"},{"heading":"The Dominion","level":2,"id":"The_Dominion_0"},{"heading":"The Breen","level":2,"id":"The_Breen_0"},{"heading":"The Ferengi","level":2,"id":"The_Ferengi_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"lore/the-galaxy-in-2385.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1757603434420,"modifiedTime":1759572930601,"sourceSize":16160,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Lore/The Galaxy in 2385.md","exportPath":"lore/the-galaxy-in-2385.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":17,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-0-all-aboard.html":{"title":"Hyperion Log 0 - All Aboard","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-0-all-aboard.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1757603434498,"modifiedTime":1763559114862,"sourceSize":541,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 1/Hyperion Log 0 - All Aboard.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-0-all-aboard.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":20,"backlinks":["mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-1.1-bacchus'-irresistible-call.html"],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-1.1-bacchus'-irresistible-call.html":{"title":"Hyperion Log 1.1 - Bacchus' Irresistible Call","icon":"","description":"The USS Hyperion was sent to investigate the disappearance of a Starfleet science shuttle at the Bacchus system.

The away team disabled the security system at the entrance to the monolith and navigated to the control room at the center.

A medical examination showed the Admiral seemed to have no influence from the Artifact's subspace signals.

Stoker wanted an away team to investigate, but Rhen Gorath and the rest of the crew refused. Stoker was furious, and threatened to have Rhen Gorath reprimanded for disobeying orders.Before the Hyperion could leave the system, a unidentified starship dropped out of warp and demanded Stoker hand over the artifact. They claimed that Stoker was in possession of their property. The unidentified ship attacked, and both ships have now sustained damage to their shields.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1757603434531,"modifiedTime":1763559151168,"sourceSize":2105,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Season 1/Hyperion Log 5.1 - The Pasqual Problem.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-5.1-the-pasqual-problem.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":28,"backlinks":["mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-5.2-the-pasqual-solution.html"],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/season-1/hyperion-log-5.2-the-pasqual-solution.html":{"title":"Hyperion Log 5.2 - The Pasqual Solution","icon":"","description":"At Pasqual-1, the Hyperion continued to engage with the Vinshari battlecruiser, which hooked onto the Hyperion with a physical harpoon.

The Nightingale's executive officer, Cmdr. Allison Lewis, was now in command. Captain Blake had died in the attack. Lewis explained that most of the ships functions had been completely disabled by the Romulan Protocol, an emergency system to prevent enemies from gaining access to Federation intel or commandeering a Federation ship.Verlath started by heading to the ship's sick-bay, and found dead and wounded taking up space even in the corridors outside. Verlath helped the nurses do triage and treated some of the worst patients. Among the dead, Verlath found Captain Blake, who had suffered a head injury apparently moments after activating the Romulan protocol.Lt. Buchanon made his way to the Nightingale's engineering room to evaluate the damage and attempt to restore power to the rest of the ship.

He extinguished the electro-plasma fire by shutting off avalve to the conduit, and then gain access to the engineering console. Although the ship's computers had completely shut off access from the the Romulan protocol, Buchanon could hot wire the engineering consoles to gain basic local functions.On board the Hyperion, Thal'vaek routinely commented on the novelty of SILAR's nature, and was morbidly curious about it. So SILAR challenged Thal'vaek to a wrestling match. The terms: If SILAR wins, then Thal'vaek would leave the Nightingale alone and return to Romulan space. If Thal'vaek won, then SILAR would submit himself for study under the Romulans.As negotiations with Thal'vaek continued, a Federation shuttle departed from the Nightingale on course to join the Warbird.

In the meantime, Admiral Stoker had been sent back to Earth on leave and replaced by Admiral April Hebert. The crew spent about a week or two on the station, taking leave and reorienting themselves to the new situation.The Hyperion arrived with additional responsibilities: they offloaded castaways from the Seku system and people who had been rescued from the planet Chaktir via Abyss Station. They also returned in control of a Romulan warbird, which had to be secured and dealt with at Narendra Station. General Kargan was please with this \"trophy\" but Herbert was more cautious, saying that it should potentially be returned to the Romulans, who the Federation was currently assisting with evacuation efforts before the Hobus system goes supernova. They would hold onto the Warbird for the time being.Captain Rhen Gorath and the senior staff checked in with the new leadership, including Admiral Hebert and General Kargan. They discussed the overall situation in the Shackleton Expanse, focusing on the Tilikaal: Who they were, what had happened to them, and what technology might still be present in the region? The leadership also raised concerns about the Romulans searching for similar things and about the Vinshari, who had become increasingly aggressive since the Hyperion had previously freed a Ha'kiv, potentially the species' sole energy source.As a result of these developments and the crew’s record, Captain Rhen Gorath was given command of a larger Luna-class heavy cruiser. The new ship was christened the USS Hyperion-A. Their first mission in the Hyperion-A was to escort a convoy of about twelve Antares-class civilian colonist freighters toward a new planet in the Shackleton Expanse. After about a week of travel, the convoy was intercepted by Vinshari pirates, who demanded the freighters’ warp cores as energy sources. Rhen Gorath responded that they were on a peaceful mission and asked the Vinshari to leave them alone, but the Vinshari proceeded to attack.The freighters took cover in a Nebula before the Vinshari cruisers launched a small fleet of fighters.

While the Hyperion-A continued attempting to negotiate, the Vinshari ships closed in on both the nebula and the Starfleet vessel.Once in position, the Vinshari launched twelve single-person fighters, which entered the nebula and moved to attack the freighters. The Hyperion-A fired a volley of quantum torpedoes that destroyed six of the fighters and damaged one of the larger Vinshari Maelstrom ships. The Hyperion-A then shifted fire to a second Vinshari Maelstrom in the area.The remaining six Vinshari fighters were able to harpoon one of the freighters and drag it toward a Vinshari Maelstrom, latching it to the larger hull. In response, the Hyperion-A flew directly into the nebula and deployed its own shuttle swarm under Commander SILAR. Within the nebula, the Hyperion-A and its shuttles used phaser fire both to damage the Vinshari ship and to sever the harpoon connections holding the freighter in place, successfully freeing the civilian ship.After the freighter was freed, the Hyperion-A continued its attack on the Vinshari Maelstrom. A further round of phaser fire completely disabled the Vinshari vessel. The second Maelstrom chose to retreat from the area, leaving its disabled counterpart and some remaining assets behind.The captain of the disabled Vinshari ship then challenged the Hyperion crew to board and fight to the death aboard the crippled vessel. Captain Rhen Gorath declined this challenge, stating that the Hyperion-A would leave the Vinshari ship to conduct its own repairs and offering help if they needed it.Because the Vinshari ship’s sensors were too damaged to locate survivors in the surrounding wreckage, the Hyperion-A used its own sensors to find Vinshari survivors in the debris field and then beamed them over to the disabled Maelstrom. Before leaving the area, the Hyperion-A took detailed scans of the Vinshari Maelstrom, sufficient to create an accurate holodeck simulation of the ship for future training, and then departed, leaving the Vinshari to repair their vessel.After leaving the site of the Vinshari attack, the Hyperion continued on to the convoy's destination planet. It was habitable, but undergoing severe dessertification. The colonist set up and got to work on initial terraforming efforts.SILAR took a shuttle to scan for underground water reservoirs, but instead found an neutronium deposit, indicating Tilikaal facilities in the area. With Enat Tera and Sorketh, they descended into the neutronium facility.

These Ithik has cybernetics plugged into them. They had been assimilated.Deeper into the Borg facility, they found an engine room with a deactivated artificial singularity reactor. In the center of this room was a pedestal with a head in a jar. The head was integrated into the ship via cybernetic implants. They welcomed the crew in and referred to many of the crew members by their names. They were incredibly surprised to learn that the Borg were still out there, but then quickly just asked if they had discovered the progenitors yet.The Borg claimed to be created by the Tilikaal, showing an image that looked remarkably like Thaccin. When asked about where the Ithik came from, the Face of Borg claimed that the Ithik were provided to it, and were of course meant to be assimilated, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.When asked what it's goals were and what it would do if it escape, the Face of Borg claimed that they would explore the stars, looking for the Tilikaal. Their ultimate goal: assimilate with them.Sorketh did some research into the history of the Borg, using his remaining Borg implants. He identified the Ithik as species number 9 under Borg designations. And the Face of Borg was identified as species number 3. Notably, these designations were not given by the Borg themselves.The crew wanted to know if the Face of Borg had a sense of empathy and a respect for independent life, unlike the Borg of the present day.

However, the Face of Borg HAD assimilated the Ithik, and so this empathy was not universal.

Akkara didn't know anything about the Borg, but implored the officers to speak to Thaccin for him. Thaccin had been avoiding the Ithik, who regarded him as a god. SILAR showed Akkara a recording of the assimilated Ithik in the Borg ship, and Akkara was horrified. He then begged the officers to go down to the planet and free his people from their fate, and even wanted to go down to the planet himself.Jarek Vossin went down to the Borg ship again to investigate the technology. He told the Face of Borg that he was attempting to begin repairs, which was not true. Jarek Vossin uncovered an encrypted log, which even the Face of Borg did not have access to. He bypassed some of the security, and revealed a recording where a Tilikaal woman dragged an Ithik out of a thank, put them on a surgery table, and manually installed Borg implants.Jonathan Belaris went to speak to Thaccin, whose memory had been broken by spending too long in a pattern butter. Belaris convinced Thaccin to undergo some neurological repair therapy. As Belarus asked Thaccin to recall certain parts of him memory, he was able to identify \"dead zones\" where lost memories were stored. Through this therapy, Thaccin was able to recall another Tilikaal named Ash-Tamalia, who apparently designed the Ithik people themselves to be like lab rats. He also remember being afraid of something, and wanting to put himself in the pattern buffer to get away from it.Rhen Gorath gave Starfleet command a call, and Admiral April Hebert gave the following direction: Eliminate the Borg threat, strongly implying that all Borg should be killed. Hebert also ordered the colonists to be evacuated permanently. But the crew of the Hyperion had another plan: liberate the assimilated Ithik and take the Face of Borg in securely for study.An away from with SILAR, Gorath, Vossin, and Belarus went back into the Borg ship. Jarek Vossin was able to convince the Face of Borg that they would need to be disconnected from the ship in order to continue repairs. They successfully disconnected the Face of Borg, and then SILAR and Belarus went to another level to attempt to disconnect a borg drone from the small collective.They drained a tank of it's gel, and a single Ithik fell to the ground before standing up. SILAR and Belarus hit the drone with a mega dose of sedatives, and it went to sleep. They disconnected a communications module from the back of the Ithik's neck, and suddenly the Ithik's own nanite's started to reject the Borg implants. The implants melted away as if my acid, leaving gaping wounds in its flesh.
