Inspired by the return of Voyager (common knowledge, but the details of how are top secret), The Federation is looking forward to a new age of exploration further than they've ever gone before. From a reddit post <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/hsl9nh/a_setting_overview_for_2380/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekadventures/comments/hsl9nh/a_setting_overview_for_2380/\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.\nThe adventure starts in the year 2385, seven years after the USS Voyager returned to Earth, and ten years after the conclusion of the Dominion War. The Alpha and Beta Quadrants are in an uneasy but stable peace.The Romulans are more wary and less arrogant in regard to the Federation. They have somehow become aware of actions Section 31 took to end the Dominion War, and contrary to the horror Federation leadership had when they learned of it, the Romulans seem to have taken it as a sign that they have gravely underestimated the Federation.From their perspective, the Federation encountered a civilization that attempted to subvert them and subjugate them in the Dominion, and instead of taking the expected actions by conceding everything one piece at a time until it was all lost, the Federation prompted direct confrontation by mining the wormhole and actively attacking their opponent’s logistical support.Once the war had begun, the Federation was able to somehow not only convince the Klingons to fight at their side, but to do so at the direction of Starfleet, which the Romulan government found to be a totally incredulous idea. A Starfleet captain had orchestrated the assassination of a Romulan Senator in order to manipulate them into fighting at the Federation’s side as well! Finally, the Federation showed a willingness to engage in total war when existentially threatened.Then: the Hobus supernova. The efforts of Spock and the Federation do little to ease the sting Romulans feel. The Federation took the lead in the evacuation of Romulus and the surrounding systems. But then, when the need for help was most dire, abandoned them. Worse, the Federation has showed that they have internal issues that can Limited trade, and the continuation of the Neutral Zone as well as the Treaty of Algeron, will maintain the status quo while the Romulans put in effort to modernize and update their fleet and empire.The Klingons have become much closer to the Federation since the victory over the Cardassians and the Dominion. Many within the Houses have suggested that the consistency of honor in battle by Starfleet is a sign of a worthy ally, and that the empire should seek to continue the friendly relationship it now has with Starfleet and the Federation.This is at odds with the renewed thirst for battle that Klingon society is experiencing, however it is obvious now that the Federation would make terrible enemies if direct conflict happened, and it is unlikely that the Federation would stand by should the Klingon Empire seek to expand once again, even if it wasn’t near the Federation.Klingon society also depends heavily at this point on dilithium imports from the Federation, and their society has become far too economically tied to the Federation for open conflict to be anything except painful.Some Klingons suggest that in primarily exploring, the average Starfleet vessel encounters more battle than the average Klingon vessel does. Because of this, there is a growing sentiment that a Klingon who joins Starfleet has a better chance of finding glory than a Klingon who serves the empire. Some have even suggested that the empire should join the Federation and find glory in defending it against the many foes it has, some of which are quite formidable such as the Borg.This sentiment is not yet widespread, and though it is talked about by many Klingons, it is always in hushed voices. There have been many more Klingons who have joined Starfleet however, and while some were unable to make it in an environment where they needed to respect and follow the orders of non-Klingon superiors, others have found their lives to be much better and more fulfilling.There is also the risk of the thirst for battle being turned inward. Without a good path to conquer other societies, and with the conflict in opinion about the Federation, the stability of the Klingon Empire is threatened, and it is possible that a civil war may break out over cooperation with the Federation. This would be just as much due to their thirst for battle having no viable outlet as it would be to the disagreement itself.Utterly ruined by the war, Cardassian society totally collapsed due to the conflict. During the post-war occupation by the Federation, Klingons, and Romulans, Cardassian society was transformed. The common Cardassian was opened to the idea that while their loyalty had always been to the state, the state’s loyalty hadn’t always been to them.The catastrophic loss of life left the people open to new ideas, and during the four years of occupation and rebuilding (which ended officially in 2379), Bajoran society was perhaps ironically a huge influence on Cardassia.Cardassians now have a nascent society which values the art and culture of their people. They are all aware of just how close their society and culture came to extermination at the hands of either the Dominion or the Alliance forces, and there is an existential need among Cardassians to show that their culture is one worth preserving. That it is better for everyone that they didn’t die to the last man.The Detapa Council has been remade, but in a move that would have been unthinkable only a decade ago, most of its members are now elected by the people. In addition to the elected members, the council has two members that are elected by members of the military, one member who is elected by members of the remade Obsidian order, and one more member who is elected by Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory. This, combined with the five members elected by the Cardassian public, make up the nine people who make up the council.A large number of Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory live on Bajor, which is to some ironic. However, it is obvious to even the most proud Cardassian how much of their survival is due to the efforts of a Bajoran freedom fighter, Kira Nerys.One of the first actions taken by the reformed Detapa Council was to make a formal apology to the people of Bajor, and a promise of reparations once Cardassian society was capable. This might have been received quite coldly, except for the words of Kira. She argued to the Council of Ministers that the Cardassian people, and Cardassian society, had received their punishment already.Her testimony of the ways in which Cardassians had suffered, and the extent of the suffering, swayed not only the Ministers, but much of Bajoran society. Many began to view the Cardassian people not as evil, but as being victims of their out-of-control military almost as much as the Bajorans had been, an analogy that Kira herself made.Because of this, the apology was accepted, but the offer of reparations was officially rejected by the Bajoran government. Their response was that any help such reparations might have provided to Bajor had already been taken care of by the Federation, and that instead the Bajorans would help the Federation in doing the same for Cardassian culture.Such help from a people that many Cardassians were aware of having suffered so brutally at their hands, a people that were not Cardassian, was one of the turning points in the rebuilding of Cardassian society.Today, Cardassia and Bajor are each the second largest populations of their respective species outside of their homeworlds, and there is extensive trade between the two. Many Cardassians have become fascinated by the Bajoran religion of the Prophets, and many Bajorans have become fascinated by the talent for art that many Cardassians have, especially when most Bajorans grew up believing that the only talent Cardassians had was brutality.Near the end of the occupation period, when Bajor was admitted to the Federation, some Cardassians began to suggest that Cardassia should also ask to join the Federation. The argument was that the Federation was already there rebuilding their society, and perhaps the way forward was the Federation to simply not leave.While this idea was considered more warily by some Cardassians, very few were vehemently opposed to it. Even so, Cardassian leadership, Bajoran advisors, and the Federation itself all argued against it.Cardassian leadership argued that the Cardassian people hadn’t ever really had the chance to figure out who they were as a people, and they needed to do this before such a thing could be considered.Bajoran leadership argued that the Cardassian people were in the same situation the Bajorans had been, and that it was important that they saw themselves stand on their own feet before making such a decision. They said that they understood and sympathized with the idea, because many on Bajor had felt the same way when the Cardassians had left and the Federation had stepped in. But they said that now they see how valuable it had been to stand on their own for a while first.The Federation argued that while they would be happy to provide whatever humanitarian assistance was necessary, there were simply too many fresh wounds that needed time to heal. The Federation Council privately told the Cardassian leadership that it was unlikely the Cardassian people would be given a fair consideration be some of its members if the request was made so soon, and that further, some members of the Federation would feel it was too much like conquering and annexing Cardassia.Cardassian society now finds itself in a stable if somewhat raw state, ready to venture out with new perspective for the first time since becoming warp capable.The final efforts of the Voyager crew with regard to the Borg are highly classified. What is commonly understood among the rank-and-file is that the Borg were dealt a severe blow, and that the Federation considers any incursion by the Borg for the foreseeable future to be unlikely.Even so, Starfleet crews and ships are still designed and trained with conflict with the Borg in mind, and though the details are known to only a select few, it is apparent to many within Starfleet that the technologies to deal with the Borg are still in active development.The status of Seven of Nine, and her existence is now widely known throughout all of the Federation, and consequently throughout the quadrant. However, whether because she has been instructed not to or because she does not wish to, she has never publicly commented on the Borg or her experiences with them.Only two further contacts with the Dominion have been made since the end of the war and the return of Odo to The Great Link. The first contact came in 2375 only weeks after the war had ended and was a more formal accounting of the parameters of surrender the Federation was imposing on the Dominion. These included prohibiting any Dominion forces from entering the Alpha Quadrant by any means, and the requirement for any Changelings who enter the Alpha Quadrant to stop at Deep Space Nine to notify the Federation of their intended destination and purpose.As an enforcement measure, the Federation imposed a mandatory search for Changelings of any vessel returning through the wormhole for at least the next 10 years. This extraordinary measure would not normally have been palatable to the Federation, but the war had been so vast and so destructive that not only Federation citizens, but even the Klingons and Romulans saw the wisdom of allowing the Federation to search all vessels returning from the Gamma Quadrant.Since neither the Romulans nor the Klingons trusted each other to not use their cloaking technology to try and evade these searches, Deep Space Nine was provided with advanced cloak scanning technology by them. This technology was provided in a closed system that was not open for study to Federation engineers, and Klingon or Romulan personnel have had to visit to maintain it any time it has suffered a malfunction.According to the agreement signed by the three governments, the technology is only ever used if the wormhole opens with no apparent ship transit. Further, all three governments are provided the results of all searches, including those done using the cloak scanning technology.The Federation did decide however to allow commerce and civilian traffic through the wormhole, no matter who it came from, deciding to operate Deep Space Nine as something like a freeport. Normal Federation import laws would not apply to Deep Space Nine unless the cargo was purely military in nature, or the destination for the cargo was within the Federation.The Dominion was surprised by this concession by the Federation, considering that they had surrendered unconditionally to save the Changelings from extinction. Over the last five years, commerce has slowly but surely increased, and this combined with the newfound understanding the Link obtained from Odo, has convinced the Dominion that it may actually be possible to maintain relations with some solids as equals at some point in the future.The second contact between the Federation and the Dominion came in 2377. It involved setting up a subspace link through the wormhole to enable open communication between the two powers in the future, and the construction effort for this relay was still underway, being hesitantly constructed from both sides.For the time being, the Dominion has remained within their borders and mostly silent.Little contact had been made with the Breen prior to the war, but the attack on Earth ensured that they were a prominent species in the mind of the Federation after the war ended. Their remaining ships retreated back to Breen space, ignoring all demands and efforts at contact from the Federation. Though many suggested that the Breen could simply be allowed to “go home without consequences”, no one was willing to immediately mount a campaign of aggression into Breen space.The Breen have remained conspicuously silent since the end of the war, even cutting off trade with the Ferengi, and seemingly every other species that the Federation has contact with. Starfleet Command remains very concerned about the reasons for this and about possible future conflict with the Breen, and their technology is being actively studied by Starfleet to prepare for the possibility of a conflict in the future.For the moment however, they seem to have retreated into isolation.In some ways Ferengi culture has changed radically. The impact of Rom becoming the Grand Nagus cannot be overstated, and Ferengi society has become far more equal among men and women. There has also been an emphasis from Rom on “long-term profits”, and how duplicitous business results in fewer business opportunities in the future.In other ways though, the Ferengi remain the Ferengi. While Ferengi privateers and plots remain a consistent problem for the Federation, their frequency has declined, and their scope is generally smaller. The Federation is not aware of any efforts to steal a Starfleet ship since the end of the war, although several thefts of Federation designed civilian ships have occurred.In general, the Ferengi seem to be holding up their end of agreements more frequently, and they have been the largest benefactors of the Federation policies regarding Deep Space Nine and the Gamma Quadrant following the war.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Timeline","level":2,"id":"Timeline_0"},{"heading":"The Romulans","level":2,"id":"The_Romulans_0"},{"heading":"The Klingons","level":2,"id":"The_Klingons_0"},{"heading":"The Cardassians","level":2,"id":"The_Cardassians_0"},{"heading":"The Borg","level":2,"id":"The_Borg_0"},{"heading":"The Dominion","level":2,"id":"The_Dominion_0"},{"heading":"The Breen","level":2,"id":"The_Breen_0"},{"heading":"The Ferengi","level":2,"id":"The_Ferengi_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"lore/the-galaxy-in-2385.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1745850846943,"modifiedTime":1747747750406,"sourceSize":16502,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Lore/The Galaxy in 2385.md","exportPath":"lore/the-galaxy-in-2385.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"lore/the-shackleton-expanse.html":{"title":"The Shackleton Expanse","icon":"","description":"The Shackleton ExpanseFar from the heart of the Federation lies the Shackleton Expanse, a massive area of space deep within the Beta Quadrant.

She has informed us that it is projected to make contact with the station in about 8 hours, and all scans are inconclusive. While the entity isn't cloaked, it is difficult to scan, refracting all scans of emitted by the Starbase around it so that we are unable to get a reading of what this is or what its intentions are. While the Klingons want to shoot this entity down, our mission is to attempt to divert this entity or stop it before it collides with the station. There may be life forms involved, and the last thing that we want to do is make first contact with a species by killing a ship full of them, if that is what's out there.We have arrived at the entity and deduced it is a ship of some kind. It appears to be alive and populated by some kind of non-corporeal life forms. While they did not respond to our hails, Lt. Buchanan and Lt. Cmdr. Silar were able to engage the ship in a rudimentary pattern recognition and response based on pulses of light from our deflector array. They repeated the pattern back to us, and after determining that this was indicative of some form of intelligence, were able to use the language we gathered from the Obelisks on Bacchus-III and the oldest recorded variants of the El-Aurian language to transmit a simple message to the ship: STOP. They complied with the request and then the ship began to roll over and show us its underside, like an injured Kata would do on Trill when showing someone where it was hurt. Scans revealed some damage to the vessel in this region, and there appears to be an unexploded torpedo of some kind. Myself, Lt. Cmdr. Silar, Dr. Verlath, and Lt. Buchanan will take a shuttle to the crystalline vessel and see if there is a way that we can help it to remove the ordinance from it's body, for lack of a better word.Silar and Buchanan were able to successfully disarm the torpedo, removing the risk of it exploding and further damaging or destroying the crystalline vessel. Dr. Verlath and I coordinated as best as we could to remove the device and also supplement the walls where it had damaged the vessel. While we were unable to keep all the walls intact, we were able to successfully remove the torpedo from the vessel. While it has warped away from the station, I doubt this is the last we've seen of it. We have made some progress in communication with the crystalline vessel and the non-corporeal beings who reside inside of it, but there is still work to be done. We have returned to the Starbase and provided the torpedo to Admiral Stoker and her teams for further study, and are awaiting our orders while we try to figure out the mystery behind both Bacchus-III and this crystalline vessel.Who are these people? Why has no one made contact with them yet? And what is behind the the washboard effect both in the region and the localized one emanating from Bacchus-III? All we can do is keep doing our jobs and living by our principles, trusting that the answers will reveal themselves along the way.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[{"heading":"First Officer's Log - 62078.6","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log_-_62078.6_0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log, Supplemental: ","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log,_Supplemental__0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log, Supplemental: ","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log,_Supplemental__1"}],"links":["mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-2-imminent-collision.html#_0","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-2.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1747844378542,"modifiedTime":1747846624665,"sourceSize":3463,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Logs/Rhen Gorath Log 2.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-2.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.1-the-orion-incident.html":{"title":"Rhen Gorath Log 3.1 - The Orion Incident","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Hyperion Log 3.1 - Orion Heist Part 1\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.1-orion-heist-part-1.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 3.1 - Orion Heist Part 1</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Rhen Gorath\" href=\"crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rhen Gorath</a>\nStardate:: 62098Log:: After some time working with SILAR to decipher the light based language of the crystalline ship, Admiral Stoker has called the Senior Staff of the Hyperion to a briefing where she informed us that the artifact we recovered from Bacchus-III had been taken. It was not clear at the time of the briefing who had taken the artifact and whether or not it was still present on the station. Our mission is to recover the artifact at all costs.While I do not disagree was to the importance of the artifact, this does make me wonder if there is something about this artifact that is being kept secret from us. Time will tell, however, we are beginning our investigation with all haste, and I hope that whomever has absconded with the artifact has not yet left the station.After a frustrating number of dead ends and red herrings, to borrow a phrase from my human colleagues, we have determined that it was the Orions who have made off with the artifact. The SS Castle Rock is commanded by Captain Paljara, and we have charted their course on a path to the Neutral Zone.Despite the best efforts from our ship and crew, we were unable to intercept the Castle Rock in time and found ourselves pursuing them into the Neutral Zone. While this is technically a violation of the treaty between The Federation and The Romulan Star Empire, we have been ordered to recover this artifact at all costs, and that is what we will do.When we finally caught up to the Castle Rock, it was too late. She was disabled, with the aft section of the ship crushed by a gravimetric field emanating from the artifact. Captain Paljara refused to allow us to recover the artifact or help her, and it was at this point we found ourselves face to face with a D'deridex Class Warbird. Subcommander Thal'vaek informed us that the Castle Rock was under their protection and transported over engineers to assist with the repairs.The quick thinking of Dr. Verlath allowed him to disguise the life signs of himself, Lieutenant Commander Tara, and Ensign Eric Jimothy, and they were beamed over along with Silar to endeavor to recover the artifact, while we simultaneously beamed over three Orions in order to not alert the crew of the Castle Rock that the number of life signs had changed.Meanwhile, I am staying behind on the ship with Captain Cerjaso to ensure that we're able to keep a tricky situation from getting out of hand.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[{"heading":"First Officer's Log - Stardate 62098:","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log_-_Stardate_62098_0"},{"heading":"First Officer's Log - Supplemental:","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log_-_Supplemental_0"}],"links":["mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.1-orion-heist-part-1.html#_0","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.1-the-orion-incident.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750147286403,"modifiedTime":1750147536265,"sourceSize":2687,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Logs/Rhen Gorath Log 3.1 - The Orion Incident.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.1-the-orion-incident.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.2-the-orion-incident.html":{"title":"Rhen Gorath Log 3.2 - The Orion Incident","icon":"","description":"Session:: <a data-href=\"Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.2-orion-heist-part-2.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 3.2 - Orion Heist Part 2</a><br>\nCharacter:: <a data-href=\"Rhen Gorath\" href=\"crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Rhen Gorath</a>\nStardate:: 62098Log:: It's always a game of chess with the Romulans, and this time was no different.

A firefight broke out, and while it was not necessarily how I would have recommended we play out this attack, Ensign Jimothy seems to have turned the tide in the firefight by targeting an explosive barrel. Unfortunately, this resulted in 3 casualties onboard the Orion vessel.Captain Paljara hailed us and begged us to allow them to escape with the artifact, which we were unable to do. She informed us that her sister had been captured by the Romulans, and if we didn't let her go with it, they were going to kill her. However, we were unable to help her in this manner. We did offer to assist in any other way we could with her sister, which she seemed to dismiss out of hand.The away team returned quickly to the vessel, and Subcommander Thal'vaek ordered his vessel to fire on the Hyperion. Thanks to Lieutenants Buchanan and th'Kerre, we were able to get to warp and high tail it back to Narendra Station with our shields up, taking minor damage to our shields before escaping the Neutral Zone.Upon our return, Admiral Stoker congratulated us on a job well done and requested the return of the artifact for inspection and evaluation. Shockingly, she declined to allow us to engage in any sort of mission to help Captain Paljara and her sister. There is something that isn't quite right here. I can't put my finger on it, but her behavior strikes me as nothing short of suspicious.Additionally, I don't believe I've seen the last of Captain Paljara, and when we do see each other again, I don't believe we'll find ourselves on the best of terms, given this exchange.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Logs"],"headers":[{"heading":"First Officer's Log - Supplemental:","level":4,"id":"First_Officer's_Log_-_Supplemental_0"}],"links":["mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-3.2-orion-heist-part-2.html#_0","crew/rhen-gorath.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.2-the-orion-incident.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1750147552657,"modifiedTime":1750147624024,"sourceSize":2233,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Logs/Rhen Gorath Log 3.2 - The Orion Incident.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/logs/rhen-gorath-log-3.2-the-orion-incident.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-0-all-aboard.html":{"title":"Hyperion Log 0 - All Aboard","icon":"","description":"\nThing Stardate:: 2030\nMission:: [[]]\nNote:: The crew of the USS Hyperion is assembled by captain Kala Cerjaso for a new mission to explore the Shackleton Expanse.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#SessionSummary/Session"],"headers":[{"heading":"Bookkeeping","level":1,"id":"Bookkeeping_0"},{"heading":"Session Summary","level":1,"id":"Session_Summary_0"},{"heading":"Summary","level":2,"id":"Summary_0"},{"heading":"Logs","level":2,"id":"Logs_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-0-all-aboard.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1745834400196,"modifiedTime":1749045977835,"sourceSize":488,"sourcePath":"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 0 - All Aboard.md","exportPath":"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-0-all-aboard.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-1.1-bacchus'-irresistible-call.html":{"title":"Hyperion Log 1.1 - Bacchus' Irresistible Call","icon":"","description":"Stardate:: 62023\nMission:: <a data-href=\"Bacchus' Irresistible Call\" href=\"shackleton-expanse/missions/season-1/bacchus'-irresistible-call.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Bacchus' Irresistible Call</a>\nNote:: The USS Hyperion was sent to investigate the disappearance of a Starfleet science shuttle at the Bacchus system.

First, an away team would return to the planet to investigate the facility, hoping to find an off switch. At the same time, a team on the Hyperion would attempt to outfit the starship to escape the Bacchus system by riding the Subspace wave out. The away team disabled the security system at the entrance to the monolith and navigated to the control room at the center.

A breadbox sized artifact that the computer described as a \"key\" was revealed, which the away team took with them. The planet produced a massive tractor beam and pulled the planet Bacchus-2 out of orbit. It began using the rocky material of the planet to create new Monoliths.On the Hyperion, Buchanon and SILAR worked to integrate SILAR more deeply into the ship's control systems. The ship's sensors were connected directly to the nacelles to respond more quickly to changes in subspace. And SILAR's decision making processes were set as the control point for ship. SILAR was able to respond more quickly to changes in the gravitational profile of the system.

Soon after, the artifact was stolen, and the crew of the Hyperion recruited to help track it down. Collectively, they narrowed the options down to an Orion ship, the SS Castle Rock, that had left the station shortly after the theft.The Hyperion was sent in pursuit of the Castle Rock before it could get to the neutral zone, but was not fast enough. There, the Castle Rock was found disabled: the back section crushed in by some gravitational field coming from the artifact. The Orion captain Paljara refused to hand over the artifact and warned the Hyperion to flee. When they didn't, a Romulan Bird of Prey decloaked and announced their intention to \"protect\" the Orion vessel, who had been given passage rights.

When the Hyperion arrive, it was violently thrown out of warp by a massive subspace distortion wave. With warp-speed rendered impossible and subspace communications completely washed out by background subspace frequencies in the system, an away was sent down to Bacchus-3 to investigate the source of the distortion waves. There, a small coalition team of Starfleet and Klingon officers seemed entranced by the giant monoliths sticking out of the surface of the planet. Soon, the scientists opened the monoliths, revealing a facility on the inside.

The Klingons were struggling to get their warp core back online and were given instructions to repair it by SILAR and Bucannon.The Klingon Captain K'tah was there looking for his brother, Brutog, who had visited the planet with Janna Frye.

First, an away team would return to the planet to investigate the facility, hoping to find an off switch. At the same time, a team on the Hyperion would attempt to outfit the starship to escape the Bacchus system by riding the Subspace wave out. The away team disabled the security system at the entrance to the monolith and navigated to the control room at the center. There a computer system informed them that the Facility was built to contained something or someone called The Displaced. Verlath was able to recognize genetic codes in the displays with telltale signs of modifications.In the end, the team disabled the subspace distortion wave, which triggered an emergency response from the facility. A breadbox sized artifact that the computer described as a \"key\" was revealed, which the away team took with them. The planet produced a massive tractor beam and pulled the planet Bacchus-2 out of orbit. It began using the rocky material of the planet to create new Monoliths.On the Hyperion, Buchanon and SILAR worked to integrate SILAR more deeply into the ship's control systems. The ship's sensors were connected directly to the nacelles to respond more quickly to changes in subspace. And SILAR's decision making processes were set as the control point for ship. SILAR was able to respond more quickly to changes in the gravitational profile of the system. Rhen Gorath piloted the waverider to meet with the Hyperion, and they all warped out of the system, back to Narendra Station.Admiral Banna Stoker debriefed the team on Narendra Station, and took the artifact for study, assigning science officer Kassandra Pruitt to investigate.\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 2 - Imminent Collision.md\" data-href=\"Shackleton Expanse/Groups/Hyperion/Shared/Mission Logs/Missions/Hyperion Log 2 - Imminent Collision.md\" href=\"mission-logs/missions/hyperion-log-2-imminent-collision.html#_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Hyperion Log 2 - Imminent Collision</a>: Stardate 62078.6The Hyperion made first contact with a new species made of crystal that communicated with refracted light.

They found a strange crystalline starship and started rudimentary and cooperative communication with it.The crew found an unidentified torpedo lodged into the side of the crystalline structure, seemingly made just for the purpose of attacking this kind of starship. As the hull of the ship seemed to be a living entity of some sort, Verlath organized a surgical transport procedure to remove the torpedo safely.Once the torpedo was removed, the aliens in the ship revealed themselves: strange crystal beings who communicated through light refraction.

Gorath and SILAR spent much of their time working on deciphering the light-based language they communicated with, making some progress on terms used during the mission. Buchanan made a deal with Nax to take a crate of stem bolts off the station.Verlath was brought into the sick bay to help stabilize Kassandra Pruitt, whose neurological functions were suddenly declining after a research project with the Bacchus Artifact. Soon after, the artifact was stolen, and the crew of the Hyperion recruited to help track it down. Collectively, they narrowed the options down to an Orion ship, the SS Castle Rock, that had left the station shortly after the theft.The Hyperion was sent in pursuit of the Castle Rock before it could get to the neutral zone, but was not fast enough. There, the Castle Rock was found disabled: the back section crushed in by some gravitational field coming from the artifact. The Orion captain Paljara refused to hand over the artifact and warned the Hyperion to flee. When they didn't, a Romulan Bird of Prey decloaked and announced their intention to \"protect\" the Orion vessel, who had been given passage rights. They also sent engineers aboard the Orion freighter to provide assistance with repairs.Verlath was able to disguise the life signs of Enat Tara and himself.
