The Alpha and Beta Quadrants are in an uneasy but stable peace.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="The Romulans" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Romulans_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>The Romulans</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Romulans are more wary and less arrogant in regard to the Federation. They have somehow become aware of actions Section 31 took to end the Dominion War, and contrary to the horror Federation leadership had when they learned of it, the Romulans seem to have taken it as a sign that they have gravely underestimated the Federation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">From their perspective, the Federation encountered a civilization that attempted to subvert them and subjugate them in the Dominion, and instead of taking the expected actions by conceding everything one piece at a time until it was all lost, the Federation prompted direct confrontation by mining the wormhole and actively attacking their opponent’s logistical support.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Once the war had begun, the Federation was able to somehow not only convince the Klingons to fight at their side, but to do so at the direction of Starfleet, which the Romulan government found to be a totally incredulous idea. A Starfleet captain had orchestrated the assassination of a Romulan Senator in order to manipulate them into fighting at the Federation’s side as well! Finally, the Federation showed a willingness to engage in total war when existentially threatened.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Limited trade, and the continuation of the Neutral Zone as well as the Treaty of Algeron, will maintain the status quo while the Romulans put in effort to modernize and update their fleet and empire.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="The Klingons" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Klingons_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>The Klingons</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Klingons have become much closer to the Federation since the victory over the Cardassians and the Dominion. Many within the Houses have suggested that the consistency of honor in battle by Starfleet is a sign of a worthy ally, and that the empire should seek to continue the friendly relationship it now has with Starfleet and the Federation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is at odds with the renewed thirst for battle that Klingon society is experiencing, however it is obvious now that the Federation would make terrible enemies if direct conflict happened, and it is unlikely that the Federation would stand by should the Klingon Empire seek to expand once again, even if it wasn’t near the Federation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Klingon society also depends heavily at this point on dilithium imports from the Federation, and their society has become far too economically tied to the Federation for open conflict to be anything except painful.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Some Klingons suggest that in primarily exploring, the average Starfleet vessel encounters more battle than the average Klingon vessel does. Because of this, there is a growing sentiment that a Klingon who joins Starfleet has a better chance of finding glory than a Klingon who serves the empire. Some have even suggested that the empire should join the Federation and find glory in defending it against the many foes it has, some of which are quite formidable such as the Borg.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This sentiment is not yet widespread, and though it is talked about by many Klingons, it is always in hushed voices. There have been many more Klingons who have joined Starfleet however, and while some were unable to make it in an environment where they needed to respect and follow the orders of non-Klingon superiors, others have found their lives to be much better and more fulfilling.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">There is also the risk of the thirst for battle being turned inward. Without a good path to conquer other societies, and with the conflict in opinion about the Federation, the stability of the Klingon Empire is threatened, and it is possible that a civil war may break out over cooperation with the Federation. This would be just as much due to their thirst for battle having no viable outlet as it would be to the disagreement itself.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="The Cardassians" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Cardassians_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>The Cardassians</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Utterly ruined by the war, Cardassian society totally collapsed due to the conflict. During the post-war occupation by the Federation, Klingons, and Romulans, Cardassian society was transformed. The common Cardassian was opened to the idea that while their loyalty had always been to the state, the state’s loyalty hadn’t always been to them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The catastrophic loss of life left the people open to new ideas, and during the four years of occupation and rebuilding (which ended officially in 2379), Bajoran society was perhaps ironically a huge influence on Cardassia.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Cardassians now have a nascent society which values the art and culture of their people. They are all aware of just how close their society and culture came to extermination at the hands of either the Dominion or the Alliance forces, and there is an existential need among Cardassians to show that their culture is one worth preserving. That it is better for everyone that they didn’t die to the last man.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Detapa Council has been remade, but in a move that would have been unthinkable only a decade ago, most of its members are now elected by the people. In addition to the elected members, the council has two members that are elected by members of the military, one member who is elected by members of the remade Obsidian order, and one more member who is elected by Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory. This, combined with the five members elected by the Cardassian public, make up the nine people who make up the council.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A large number of Cardassians which live outside of Cardassian territory live on Bajor, which is to some ironic. However, it is obvious to even the most proud Cardassian how much of their survival is due to the efforts of a Bajoran freedom fighter, Kira Nerys.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One of the first actions taken by the reformed Detapa Council was to make a formal apology to the people of Bajor, and a promise of reparations once Cardassian society was capable. This might have been received quite coldly, except for the words of Kira. She argued to the Council of Ministers that the Cardassian people, and Cardassian society, had received their punishment already.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Her testimony of the ways in which Cardassians had suffered, and the extent of the suffering, swayed not only the Ministers, but much of Bajoran society. Many began to view the Cardassian people not as evil, but as being victims of their out-of-control military almost as much as the Bajorans had been, an analogy that Kira herself made.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Because of this, the apology was accepted, but the offer of reparations was officially rejected by the Bajoran government. Their response was that any help such reparations might have provided to Bajor had already been taken care of by the Federation, and that instead the Bajorans would help the Federation in doing the same for Cardassian culture.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Such help from a people that many Cardassians were aware of having suffered so brutally at their hands, a people that were not Cardassian, was one of the turning points in the rebuilding of Cardassian society.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Today, Cardassia and Bajor are each the second largest populations of their respective species outside of their homeworlds, and there is extensive trade between the two. Many Cardassians have become fascinated by the Bajoran religion of the Prophets, and many Bajorans have become fascinated by the talent for art that many Cardassians have, especially when most Bajorans grew up believing that the only talent Cardassians had was brutality.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Near the end of the occupation period, when Bajor was admitted to the Federation, some Cardassians began to suggest that Cardassia should also ask to join the Federation. The argument was that the Federation was already there rebuilding their society, and perhaps the way forward was the Federation to simply not leave.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">While this idea was considered more warily by some Cardassians, very few were vehemently opposed to it. Even so, Cardassian leadership, Bajoran advisors, and the Federation itself all argued against it.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Cardassian leadership argued that the Cardassian people hadn’t ever really had the chance to figure out who they were as a people, and they needed to do this before such a thing could be considered.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Bajoran leadership argued that the Cardassian people were in the same situation the Bajorans had been, and that it was important that they saw themselves stand on their own feet before making such a decision. They said that they understood and sympathized with the idea, because many on Bajor had felt the same way when the Cardassians had left and the Federation had stepped in. But they said that now they see how valuable it had been to stand on their own for a while first.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Federation argued that while they would be happy to provide whatever humanitarian assistance was necessary, there were simply too many fresh wounds that needed time to heal. The Federation Council privately told the Cardassian leadership that it was unlikely the Cardassian people would be given a fair consideration be some of its members if the request was made so soon, and that further, some members of the Federation would feel it was too much like conquering and annexing Cardassia.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Cardassian society now finds itself in a stable if somewhat raw state, ready to venture out with new perspective for the first time since becoming warp capable.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="The Borg" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Borg_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>The Borg</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The final efforts of the Voyager crew with regard to the Borg are highly classified. What is commonly understood among the rank-and-file is that the Borg were dealt a severe blow, and that the Federation considers any incursion by the Borg for the foreseeable future to be unlikely.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Even so, Starfleet crews and ships are still designed and trained with conflict with the Borg in mind, and though the details are known to only a select few, it is apparent to many within Starfleet that the technologies to deal with the Borg are still in active development.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The status of Seven of Nine, and her existence is now widely known throughout all of the Federation, and consequently throughout the quadrant. However, whether because she has been instructed not to or because she does not wish to, she has never publicly commented on the Borg or her experiences with them.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="The Dominion" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Dominion_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>The Dominion</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Only two further contacts with the Dominion have been made since the end of the war and the return of Odo to The Great Link. The first contact came in 2375 only weeks after the war had ended and was a more formal accounting of the parameters of surrender the Federation was imposing on the Dominion. These included prohibiting any Dominion forces from entering the Alpha Quadrant by any means, and the requirement for any Changelings who enter the Alpha Quadrant to stop at Deep Space Nine to notify the Federation of their intended destination and purpose.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As an enforcement measure, the Federation imposed a mandatory search for Changelings of any vessel returning through the wormhole for at least the next 10 years. This extraordinary measure would not normally have been palatable to the Federation, but the war had been so vast and so destructive that not only Federation citizens, but even the Klingons and Romulans saw the wisdom of allowing the Federation to search all vessels returning from the Gamma Quadrant.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Since neither the Romulans nor the Klingons trusted each other to not use their cloaking technology to try and evade these searches, Deep Space Nine was provided with advanced cloak scanning technology by them. This technology was provided in a closed system that was not open for study to Federation engineers, and Klingon or Romulan personnel have had to visit to maintain it any time it has suffered a malfunction.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">According to the agreement signed by the three governments, the technology is only ever used if the wormhole opens with no apparent ship transit. Further, all three governments are provided the results of all searches, including those done using the cloak scanning technology.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Federation did decide however to allow commerce and civilian traffic through the wormhole, no matter who it came from, deciding to operate Deep Space Nine as something like a freeport. Normal Federation import laws would not apply to Deep Space Nine unless the cargo was purely military in nature, or the destination for the cargo was within the Federation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Dominion was surprised by this concession by the Federation, considering that they had surrendered unconditionally to save the Changelings from extinction. Over the last five years, commerce has slowly but surely increased, and this combined with the newfound understanding the Link obtained from Odo, has convinced the Dominion that it may actually be possible to maintain relations with some solids as equals at some point in the future.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The second contact between the Federation and the Dominion came in 2377. It involved setting up a subspace link through the wormhole to enable open communication between the two powers in the future, and the construction effort for this relay was still underway, being hesitantly constructed from both sides.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For the time being, the Dominion has remained within their borders and mostly silent.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="The Breen" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Breen_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>The Breen</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Little contact had been made with the Breen prior to the war, but the attack on Earth ensured that they were a prominent species in the mind of the Federation after the war ended. Their remaining ships retreated back to Breen space, ignoring all demands and efforts at contact from the Federation. Though many suggested that the Breen could simply be allowed to “go home without consequences”, no one was willing to immediately mount a campaign of aggression into Breen space.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Breen have remained conspicuously silent since the end of the war, even cutting off trade with the Ferengi, and seemingly every other species that the Federation has contact with. Starfleet Command remains very concerned about the reasons for this and about possible future conflict with the Breen, and their technology is being actively studied by Starfleet to prepare for the possibility of a conflict in the future.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For the moment however, they seem to have retreated into isolation.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="The Ferengi" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_Ferengi_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>The Ferengi</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In some ways Ferengi culture has changed radically. The impact of Rom becoming the Grand Nagus cannot be overstated, and Ferengi society has become far more equal among men and women. There has also been an emphasis from Rom on “long-term profits”, and how duplicitous business results in fewer business opportunities in the future.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In other ways though, the Ferengi remain the Ferengi. While Ferengi privateers and plots remain a consistent problem for the Federation, their frequency has declined, and their scope is generally smaller. The Federation is not aware of any efforts to steal a Starfleet ship since the end of the war, although several thefts of Federation designed civilian ships have occurred.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In general, the Ferengi seem to be holding up their end of agreements more frequently, and they have been the largest benefactors of the Federation policies regarding Deep Space Nine and the Gamma Quadrant following the war.</p></div><div class="footer"><div class="data-bar"></div></div></div></div></div><div id="right-content" class="leaf" style="--sidebar-width: var(--sidebar-width-right);"><div id="right-sidebar" class="sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"><label class="theme-toggle-container" for="theme-toggle-input" id=""><input class="theme-toggle-input" type="checkbox" id="theme-toggle-input"><div class="toggle-background"></div></label></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content-wrapper"><div id="right-sidebar-content" class="leaf-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="feature-header"><div class="feature-title">Interactive Graph</div></div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
